/**
 * Bundles the designlayer overlay, and the tokens the start screen needs.
 *
 * The overlay output is concatenated onto the vendored React Rewrite bundle by
 * the package runtime, so it must be a self-contained IIFE with no imports and
 * no globals beyond the bridge it reads from `window`.
 *
 * The tokens output exists because `src/core/tokens.ts` is the only source of
 * colour in this package and the start screen is served by plain ESM, before
 * any bundling happens and with no TypeScript loader in the process. Emitting
 * the same module twice — once into the browser IIFE, once as ESM Node can
 * import — is what lets the front door wear the chrome without a second copy
 * of the values.

/**
 * React's own dead-code probe, removed — because this bundle is not minified.
 *
 * `react-dom/index.js` ships a `checkDCE()` that hands ITSELF to React
 * DevTools, which reads the function back with `Function.prototype.toString`
 * and looks for the literal `'^_^'`. The string sits in a branch that only runs
 * in development, so a production build is supposed to have dropped it — and
 * with `minify: false` esbuild folds the condition to `if (false)` and leaves
 * the body sitting there in plain sight. The hook then reports, on every single
 * page load and twice:
 *
 *   React is running in production mode, but dead code elimination has not
 *   been applied.
 *
 * It is a false positive — the branch is genuinely unreachable — but the probe
 * cannot tell, and two console errors from a tool whose job is to sit quietly
 * beside somebody else's app is not a cost worth paying. The alternatives are
 * worse: `minifySyntax` clears it by comma-joining and re-declaring the
 * editor's OWN code, and turning `minify` on gives up a readable `dist/` for
 * one vendored string.
 *
 * Exact-once, in the spirit of `runtime/vendor-patch.mjs`: a React release that
 * renames or duplicates the probe should stop the build rather than quietly
 * stop being handled here.

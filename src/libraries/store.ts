/**
 * Added libraries in the browser: the cache, the calls that change it, and the
 * merge that folds what is enabled into the catalog every panel already reads.
 *
 * The merge is the whole feature. Nothing in the inspector knows libraries
 * exist — `tokensForProperty`, `authoredTokenMatches` and `computedTokenMatches`
 * take a registry, that registry now comes from `activeDesignSystem()`, and a
 * library's colour reaches the fill picker by being in the array the fill
 * picker was always walking. Every alternative to that costs the same thing
 * twice: a second list beside the host's is a second sort order, a second
 * grouping, a second set of matching rules, and a second place for the answer
 * to be wrong. So this module produces ONE catalog and the rest of the editor
 * is left exactly as it was.
 *
 * Three properties of the merge are load-bearing rather than tidy:
 *
 *  - **zero libraries costs nothing.** With nothing enabled — which is nearly
 *    every session — `activeDesignSystem()` hands back `config.designSystem`
 *    itself, the same object, not a copy of it. A rebuilt-but-equal catalog on
 *    every inspector render would be invisible to a `deepEqual` and fatal to a
 *    `===`, and it would rebuild a whole token index for every frame of a
 *    number scrub.
 *  - **ids are prefixed with the library they came from.** `color:brand-500` is
 *    the most ordinary name a design system has, so two libraries shipping it
 *    is the normal case. `tokenIndex` in `core/design-system.ts` keys by id, and
 *    an unprefixed collision there does not throw: the picker keeps showing
 *    both rows and one of them starts writing the other's variable.
 *  - **the host's own tokens are untouched.** They are concatenated first and
 *    never copied, so a host token can never come back stamped with a library,
 *    and the four groups a library may not contribute to — breakpoints,
 *    container breakpoints, responsive measures and aliases — are passed
 *    through by reference. Breakpoints are a compile-time fact of the host's
 *    build; a prefix borrowed from a library would compile to nothing.
 *
 * Loading follows `core/icon-set.ts` exactly, for the reasons stated there: one
 * shared in-flight promise, a warning and an empty answer on failure, and a
 * failure that is never cached — a dev server that was still starting has to be
 * askable again. Mutations are the opposite and REJECT, because every one of
 * them is a button a person just pressed and the panel has to be able to say so.

 * stronger bond than the name is. Name matches come first because a name is

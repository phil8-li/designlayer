/**
 * Libraries: which design systems this project can borrow from, and which of
 * them the rest of the editor is allowed to offer.
 *
 * It is a SECTION on the right panel's Design system tab now, built with the
 * same `section()` every block on the Design tab is built with, so it folds,
 * aligns and spaces exactly like Fill and Typography. Two surfaces were folded
 * into it and one was deleted outright, which is the thing a reader arriving
 * here needs told first:
 *
 *  - the library MANAGER, a dialog opened from the old Assets panel's header,
 *    is this section. Same store, same six calls, same switch;
 *  - the Assets BROWSER — the component grid, the cards, the thumbnails, the
 *    group and library drill-down, the search box, the details popover, "Insert
 *    instance" and drag-to-insert — is gone, deliberately and by request. It is
 *    not hiding behind a fold here and it has not moved somewhere else.
 *
 * **The catalog itself is untouched.** Deleting the browser removed a way of
 * LOOKING at the components an enabled library publishes; it removed nothing
 * from the catalog those components live in. `activeDesignSystem()` still folds
 * every enabled library's tokens into the one catalog the fill picker, the
 * text-style field, the radius field and the icon picker all read, and
 * `libraryComponents()` still feeds the Design tab's instance properties. Turn
 * a library on here and all of that grows its contents on the next repaint;
 * turn it off and they lose them. That is the whole of what this section is
 * for, and it is why the empty state says it in words.
 *
 * ## The two ways in, and why they are not peers
 *
 * A URL is the CTA: a design system published on the web, or a Storybook, is
 * one paste and the server does the rest. A file in this project is a fold
 * underneath it, because it is the rarer act and its flow is two controls wide
 * — a scan of the project, and a path box for the file the scan missed. It is
 * kept because the URL box genuinely cannot do it: a designer's own
 * `tokens.css` has no address, and dropping the fold would take the only route
 * to it with it.
 *
 * ## The one thing here that is not in the panel
 *
 * A link behind a sign-in wall is refused, and answering it is a MODAL — a real
 * `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`, living on `document.body` rather than
 * in this column. Everything else on this surface is a list or a box you can
 * ignore; that one is a question that has to be answered before the add the
 * designer already asked for can land, and it wants the width a 70-character
 * OAuth client id and an 800-character token actually need. The long version is
 * at the dialog's own construction, below the CTA.
 *
 * Nothing in this file parses a design system. It renders `Library` records and
 * calls the store, which is what keeps the surface swappable without touching
 * the parsing at either end.

 * What each wall means, said the way a designer would say it.
 *
 * THESE USED TO BE THE PROTOCOL'S OWN WORDS — "OAuth sign-in", "HTTP Basic
 * auth", "Bearer token", "Sign-in redirect", "Access refused" — and the reason
 * they are not any more is the whole of this table's point. Every one of them
 * is accurate, and not one of them is the sentence a designer needs. Somebody
 * who pastes an internal Storybook link and is told "Sign-in redirect" has
 * learned a fact about HTTP; what they wanted to know is whether the link is
 * wrong, whether the editor is broken, or whether the site is simply private.
 * It is the third one, every time, and that is what these say.
 *
 * The mechanism has not been thrown away — it is still what picks the default
 * credential below, and the server's own hint still prints it verbatim for the
 * person who opens the fold and is going to go and mint a token. It is just no
 * longer the FIRST thing said, because for almost everybody it is also the
 * last thing they need.
 *
 * Four sentences for five kinds, and the merges are deliberate:
 *
 *  - **oauth and redirect both become "needs you to sign in".** SSO and a plain
 *    login bounce are one experience from outside — the site wants a human to
 *    log in — and the only thing that differs is a protocol detail, which is
 *    behind the fold where it belongs;
 *  - **basic stays separate** because it is the one wall a designer might
 *    genuinely already hold the answer to, in a password manager;
 *  - **forbidden stays separate** because it is the one that is NOT fixed by
 *    signing in. The editor got through the door and was turned away, which
 *    means the account needs access rather than the session needs a login, and
 *    telling someone to sign in there sends them round a loop.
 *
 * Written to complete "<host> …", so each is a verb phrase and none of them
 * names a company's identity product — `classifyWall` reads a status code, a
 * `WWW-Authenticate` scheme and the shape of a redirect, and never a hostname,
 * so a label claiming to know WHICH sign-in this is would be a guess.

   * A MODAL, and that is the decision this block is built around.
   *
   * It used to be a well that unfolded under the URL row, in a 260px column,
   * between the CTA and the list of installed libraries. Three things were
   * wrong with that, and all three are the same thing said at different sizes:
   *
   *  - **the column is the wrong shape for the content.** What this asks for is
   *    an 800-character bearer token, beside a 70-character OAuth client id on
   *    a plate. At 260px minus the section's padding the id wraps five times
   *    and the field shows about thirty characters of the paste. The dialog is
   *    420px and the same content fits in half the height;
   *  - **it was a question asked from the corner of the room.** A wall stops
   *    the errand the designer is on — the add does not land until this is
   *    answered — and an inline block states that by growing quietly below the
   *    box while the rest of the panel stays live. A modal is the only surface
   *    in this chrome whose shape means "answer this or leave";
   *  - **it competed with the thing it interrupted.** The list, the switches
   *    and the local-file fold all stayed clickable underneath, so a designer
   *    could flip a library on mid-sign-in and watch the block survive a
   *    repaint it had to be engineered not to be eaten by.
   *
   * `showModal()` supplies the part that matters and none of it is written
   * here: the top layer, above every stacking context the host page and this
   * chrome have between them; the focus trap; the inertness of everything
   * behind; and `::backdrop` as the dim. The same call `shell/shortcuts.ts`
   * makes for the one other modal in the editor, and for the same reasons —
   * that file's header is the long version.
   *
   * ## Two things that did NOT change with the shape
   *
   * **It is built once and never rebuilt.** What a designer puts in this box is
   * a token they fetched from another program, and the list behind it repaints
   * on every store notification. A dialog rebuilt on one of those beats would
   * take the paste with it. So the nodes are made here and the only thing that
   * moves afterwards is their text.
   *
   * **It hangs off `document.body`, not off the section.** Both of the
   * enclosures it would otherwise sit in can be taken away underneath it: the
   * section body is `hidden` while the section is folded, and the right panel
   * goes `visibility: hidden` when the chrome stands down. Neither is survivable
   * for a top-layer element — `display` and `visibility` still reach it through
   * the DOM ancestry, top layer or not — and the failure is a modal that has
   * made the page inert and cannot be seen. The chrome standing down closes it
   * outright instead; see the subscription at the foot of this file.

   * doing: it swaps to the waiting note when a window opens, swaps again when
   * the wait has gone on, and swaps back when it ends. None of those were

   * change to an `aria-describedby` target is read when the dialog opens and
   * never again. So a screen-reader user pressed Sign in and heard silence for
   * up to six minutes, and then heard silence again when it failed.
   *
   * A live region is the mechanism that fits, and this node is the right one to

   * second copy to keep in step and no visually-hidden twin saying the same

   * The refusal, on the surface rather than in a toast — and OUTSIDE THE FOLD,

   *
   * A toast is gone in four seconds and this sentence is the whole of what
   * separates "this token has expired" from "this token is for another site" —
   * a designer reads it, looks back at the box the token is still sitting in,
   * and fixes one of the two. It is `role="alert"` because the press that
   * produced it moved no focus, so nothing else would announce it.
   *
   * ## Why it is built here and appended to the DIALOG rather than to the panel
   *
   * It used to be the last child of `signInPanel`, next to the credential box,
   * which reads perfectly for the token path and was catastrophic for the other
   * one. The panel is `hidden` whenever the "I have an access token" fold is
   * shut, and shut is the default for every new wall — the whole design of this
   * surface is that most readers never open it. Worse than `hidden`: the drawer
   * clips the panel to a zero-height grid row and `.de-lib-signin-panel[hidden]`
   * adds `visibility: hidden`, so the node was not merely below the fold, it was
   * unrenderable and its `role="alert"` was dead with it.
   *
   * Every failure the WINDOW sign-in can produce was written there. A closed
   * window, a site that still refuses after a successful login, a dropped
   * connection, and — the sharpest one — the sentence this codebase wrote
   * specifically so a designer on a stale server process would know to restart
   * it. All of them landed in a node nobody could see. What the designer got
   * was a button that went grey, came back, and changed nothing else. That is
   * the "the modal gets stuck with no explanation" report, exactly.
   *
   * ONE line for both paths rather than one in the fold and one out here. Two
   * would drift, and the fold-shut reader — who is the common case — needs the
   * out-of-fold one anyway; the token reader loses a little adjacency and keeps
   * the whole sentence. It sits directly above the actions row, so it is under
   * the submit when the fold is open and under the toggle when it is shut, in

   * not a cancel — it takes the dialog away and leaves the request running, so

   * comes back. That also disposes of the focus problem the old shape had —
   * disabling the button somebody just pressed drops their focus to `<body>`,
   * which this file warns about twice for `addFrom` and then did anyway — since
   * there is now a live control to move focus TO.

 * Every change the designer made this session, as the outbox reads it back.
 *
 * The panel is one list with two kinds of row. Notes say what is wrong; edits
 * are the part the designer already fixed. `change-prompt.ts` keeps a ledger
 * too and this is deliberately not it — that one holds the SUBSET "Apply to
 * code" could not write, because its job is to be the second half of Apply.
 * This holds every edit, written or not, because its job is to be the record
 * of what happened. An agent handed only the unwritable ones reads a session
 * that moved a card, retyped its heading and deleted its sibling as a session
 * that swapped one icon.
 *
 * Nothing here is persisted, and that is the one decision in this file worth
 * arguing about. `store.ts` writes its notes to `localStorage` because a note
 * is about the design and survives a restart intact. An edit is not: it is a
 * `from` and a `to` against the source tree exactly as it stood when the edit
 * was made. Reload tomorrow, after the file has moved on, and a restored
 * journal hands an agent "set `padding-left` to 24px, currently 16px" for a
 * rule that now reads 32px — a diff against code nobody has. The journal dies
 * with the session on purpose.

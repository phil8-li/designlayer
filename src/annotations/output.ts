/**
 * What the editor knows about a place, and the brief it hands to an agent.
 *
 * Two jobs, and they are one file because they are one contract: the capture
 * side decides which facts survive the page reloading, and the serialize side
 * is the only reader of them. Splitting the two put the cap on `text` in one
 * file and the code that printed a 4KB paragraph in another.
 *
 * CAPTURE runs inside the click that creates a note, so everything here is
 * synchronous. That rules out `resolveElementSource`, which is a sourcemap
 * fetch and sometimes a grep — holding the marker until it lands would mean a
 * pointer gesture that visibly waits. What it does instead is ask the editor
 * store whether the answer is already known (see `sourceOf`), and otherwise
 * report no file rather than a guess.
 *
 * SERIALIZE writes Agentation's `## Page Feedback` format — the same header,
 * the same `### N.` items, the same `**Location:**` / `**Source:**` /
 * `**Feedback:**` fields at the same four detail levels. Agentation runs beside
 * this editor as a companion, and a designer using both should not hand an
 * agent two different documents for the same kind of note. The one thing this
 * says that Agentation never has to is WHICH KIND of edit each item is. A brief
 * that mixes "the designer already did this" with "the designer wants this" is
 * how an agent ends up reverting work that is already in the file it just
 * opened, so every edit carries a `**Status:**` of its own.

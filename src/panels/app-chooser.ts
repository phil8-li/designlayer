/**
 * The app chooser: the name of the thing being edited, and the menu that
 * changes it.
 *
 * Every other surface in this editor is a view of ONE app — the tree lists its
 * elements, the inspector describes one of them, the audit reports on all of
 * them. Until this control existed, the name of that app appeared nowhere, and
 * the only way to point the editor at a different one was the toolbar's "Choose
 * app" anchor, which navigated away to the start screen and left you to pick
 * again from scratch. That is a strange shape for the most consequential
 * control in the chrome: the one thing that decides what everything else is
 * about was also the one thing you could only change by leaving.
 *
 * So it is a button that names the app and a menu that lists the alternatives,
 * and the menu IS the chooser — the rows are the running prototypes and
 * switching happens on click, with no intermediate screen. The start screen is
 * still what actually performs the swap, because it owns the supervisor that
 * can kill this editor and spawn the next one; the difference is that the
 * designer never sees it as a place they have to visit.
 *
 * ## Why the menu is not a child of the panel
 *
 * `.de-panel` is `overflow: hidden` and the trigger sits at the very top of a
 * 240px column, so a menu mounted beside it would be clipped by its own
 * container on both axes — the rows past the fold would simply not exist.
 *
 * `context.slots.overlay` is the obvious escape hatch and is the WRONG one
 * here, which is the single place this file departs from what it was asked for.
 * `css/base.ts` orders the shell's layers inside `.de-root`: the overlay is
 * `z-index: 1` and the rail holding both panels is `z-index: 2`. A positioned
 * element with a z-index establishes a stacking context, so nothing appended to
 * the overlay can paint above the rail no matter what z-index it asks for — and
 * `.de-panel` has an opaque `background`. The menu would have been perfectly
 * unclipped and perfectly invisible, hidden behind the panel it drops out of.
 *
 * `document.body` with a z-index above `.de-root` is what the other popover
 * launched from this panel already does — see `.de-asset-details` in
 * `css/assets.ts`, which escapes the same clip for the same reason. Reusing its
 * answer keeps one pattern for "a panel control opened a floating card" rather
 * than two, and it is the only mount point in this document from which the card
 * can be both unclipped and on top.
 *
 * ## Why a network failure on the switch is USUALLY the success path
 *
 * The POST asks the start screen to start another app, and the first thing the
 * supervisor does once it accepts is SIGTERM this editor — which is the process
 * serving the proxy this page is loaded from and the route the POST is in
 * flight to. So the happy path frequently ends with a dropped connection and no
 * response at all. Treating that as an error would show a failure message on
 * every successful switch.
 *
 * What that reasoning could not do was tell the supervisor killing us apart
 * from a loopback fetch that failed for any other reason — a proxy restarting
 * under a config change, a laptop that slept mid-request, an abort. Read as
 * success, those put "Starting X…" on screen over an editor that is working
 * perfectly, held the menu open against Escape, and only gave up when a
 * fifteen-second death budget expired. The avoided error was cosmetic; the
 * false positive blocked the whole editor.
 *
 * So a dropped connection asks one more question before it commits to the
 * story, and the question is exactly the thing that distinguishes the two
 * cases: `proxyAlive()`. No answer means the process serving this page is gone,
 * which only the supervisor can have done, and the handover proceeds. An answer
 * means nothing was killed, so nothing switched, and the ordinary failure path
 * reports it. A JSON error body is a third animal entirely: the server is alive
 * and declining, so that one is reported and nothing navigates.
 *
 * ## Why one of the two row kinds arms before it goes
 *
 * An `editor` row is a navigation to a proxy that is already serving. An `app`
 * row asks a supervisor to SIGTERM this process and bind a replacement to its
 * port, then waits the handover out — and if the replacement never binds there
 * is nothing to come back to.
 *
 * Both of them end this document, and ending this document ends the three
 * queues that hold unapplied edits: the removal queue, the Angular queue and
 * the vendor store are all in memory, and nothing in this package writes a
 * `beforeunload`. This file used to argue that a switch costs nothing because
 * the pinned notes and the preview-only ledger are filed per app. That is true
 * of those two and only those two, and the sentence was read as though it
 * covered everything a designer might be holding. It does not.
 *
 * So the confirm is spent where it buys most and costs least. The `app` row
 * arms, and only when `hasPendingChanges()` says there is something to lose:
 * the common empty session keeps its single click, because a navigation that
 * answers the first click with a question has to be performed twice every time,
 * and the second click appears exactly when the loss is real. The `editor` row
 * keeps its single click even with work outstanding, because it is the
 * reversible one — the editor you land on lists the one you came from, so the
 * way back is one more press of the same control, whereas a failed handover
 * leaves no control at all. The edits are gone on both paths, which is worth
 * knowing and is written down here rather than argued away.

   * The row the user pressed reports its own handover, in the slot that

   * ## Why there is no longer a height to pin
   *
   * This used to measure the row and write the measurement into `min-height`
   * before touching anything, and the pin was real work for a real problem: the
   * row was two lines, the second of them a wrapping url, so a phrase swapped
   * into it was one line for a short path and two for a long one and the card
   * resized under a pointer that was waiting for the page to be replaced.
   *
   * A one-line row has no such thing to protect. The slot is `flex: none` and
   * `white-space: nowrap` in the sheet, so whatever is written into it stays on
   * one line by construction, and the pin became a measurement taken on every
   * switch, written into an inline style, cleared on the failure path and
   * load-bearing nowhere. Dead code that measures something looks far more
   * necessary than dead code that does not, which is why it is called out here
   * rather than quietly removed.
   *
   * The constraint the pin existed for has not gone anywhere: the row must not
   * change height or line count while it is handing over. It is now the sheet's
   * job, and the phrase's — which is why the phrase is one word. The slot takes
   * its width out of the name beside it, and a phrase long enough to push a
   * long name onto a second line would move the card exactly as the old wrap
   * did.
   *
   * ## Why one phrase and not two
   *
   * There were two, "asking the supervisor" and then "waiting for it to come
   * up", named as the separately observable stages of the request. The second
   * one was never observable: `leave()` runs in the same task and replaces the
   * whole card with the handover note, so the row it was written into was
   * detached before a frame could paint it. One phrase, on the row, for as long
   * as the row exists; the sentence that covers the rest of the wait is the

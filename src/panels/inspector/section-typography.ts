/**
 * Type controls, shown only for elements that render text themselves.
 *
 * A wrapper whose text lives in a child gets no type panel: editing it there
 * would set an inherited value the child may quietly override.
 *
 * ## The two type rows that moved in from `Design system`
 *
 * `Text style` and `Text color` were pickers in a section of their own, thirty
 * rows below this one. A designer recolouring a heading met `Text color`
 * reading `#1b2e5d` there and `Color` reading `#1b2e5d` here, with nothing in
 * either row saying they were the same declaration — and only one of the two
 * could write a token. Two controls for one property are not two ways to do
 * the job; they are a question about which one wins that the panel never
 * answers.
 *
 * So the colour one is not a row at all any more, it is half of the row that
 * was already here. A token and a hex are the SAME answer at two levels of
 * precision, which makes them one control: the field reads the bound style's
 * name when there is one and the plain value when there is not, and the plain
 * value is the string the hex input was showing anyway. The colour well stays
 * beside it, because a well is direct manipulation and a list of names is not.
 * Swatch, then either a style name or a hex, is Figma's paint row.
 *
 * `Text style` keeps a captioned block of its own — it binds four declarations
 * at once and has no single control here to fold into — and it sits at the TOP
 * of the section, above family, size, weight and spacing, because it is the
 * thing that SETS all four. Under them it would be the summary printed after
 * the detail it summarises.

 * The rag, as four drawings rather than four typed characters.
 *
 * These were `◧ ▣ ◨ ▤` — Geometric Shapes block, chosen because a half-filled
 * square is the nearest thing in Unicode to a left-aligned paragraph. It was
 * never close: the mark said "a box, part of which is dark", where the control
 * sets where a line of text starts. The four drawn marks are literally ragged
 * lines, which is the thing itself.
 *
 * Named apart from the six object-align glyphs in `section-position.ts`: those
 * move a BOX inside its parent, these set a paragraph's rag, and the two
 * families would otherwise be one keystroke apart at every call site.
 *
 * The vertical triple below is named on the same rule and needs it harder,
 * because unlike the rag marks it does not get its own drawings. `TextAlignTop`
 * and `TextAlignBottom` are `ArrowUpToLine` and `ArrowDownToLine` — the very
 * two arrows `section-position.ts` already draws for "bring to front" and "send
 * to back". One drawing, three jobs: an arrow to a line means "move this box to
 * the end of the stack" there and "sit the text against the top of its box"
 * here. Calling them by what they DO at this call site is the only thing
 * stopping a later reader from assuming the two strips share a purpose because
 * they share a `d` attribute.
 *
 * Four cells here where Figma draws three. Figma keeps justify in the popover
 * behind the type-settings button (measured: section 7 of the spec), and we
 * have no popover to keep it in — so matching the screenshot would mean
 * deleting `text-align: justify` from the editor outright. Losing a function to
 * gain a resemblance is the wrong trade; the rail carries a fourth cell until
 * there is a popover to move it into.

/**
 * The property that actually moves this element's text up and down, or null
 * when there isn't one.
 *
 * Three candidates, and the first two are traps.
 *
 * `vertical-align` is the reflex and it is inert here: it positions an inline
 * box against its line box, or a cell against its row, and does nothing
 * whatsoever on the block container a text element usually is. It is also
 * absent from `core/tailwind.ts`, so it would be dropped on the way to source
 * as well as doing nothing on screen — wrong twice, the same way the `transform`
 * nudges described in `section-layout.ts` were.
 *
 * `align-content` is the genuinely modern answer — since Chrome 123 it aligns
 * the content of a plain block container, which is exactly this control's job,
 * and Tailwind spells it `content-start`/`content-center`/`content-end`. It is
 * still wrong for us, for the one reason that outranks correctness in CSS here:
 * `core/tailwind.ts` has no `align-content` entry, in `KEYWORDS` or `SCALARS`.
 * `toClassUpdate` returns null for it, and `writeStyles` files a null update as
 * preview-only — the inline style lands, the canvas moves, and "Apply to code"
 * writes nothing. A control that appears to work and reaches no file is worse
 * than a control that is honestly unavailable, which is the lesson
 * `section-align.ts` and `section-layout.ts` were each written to record.
 *
 * So: `justify-content` on a flex column and `align-items` on a flex row or a
 * grid. Both are in `KEYWORDS` with `flex-start`/`center`/`flex-end` mapped to
 * real utilities, which is also why `VERTICAL` spells its values that way —
 * `start` and `end` are valid CSS and are NOT in the table, so writing the
 * shorter word would silently take the same preview-only path we are avoiding.
 * A bare text node inside a flex or grid container is wrapped in an anonymous
 * item, so these move the text itself and not merely a child element.
 *
 * Everything else — block, inline, table — has no writable answer, and gets the
 * rail disabled with a hint rather than a button that lies.

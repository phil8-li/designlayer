 * Four mutually exclusive states on one rail.

 * These were `⊘ → ↓ ⤶` in four bare buttons, and the strip is where a typed
 * glyph fails most visibly: four characters from four different Unicode blocks,
 * resolved by whatever font covered each, arriving at four different weights and
 * two different sizes in a row of buttons that are all the same button. `⤶` is
 * outside the coverage of several system fonts entirely and rendered as a
 * missing-glyph box.
 *
 * The rail is the other half of the fix. A row of separate buttons says nothing
 * about how the four relate; a continuous track with one raised chip says the
 * answer is exactly one of these, which is what `display`/`flex-direction`/
 * `flex-wrap` collapse to here.
 *
 * AND THE MARKS ARE NOW FOUR ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SAME TWO BOXES.
 *
 * Replacing the typed characters with drawn ones fixed the weights and left the
 * subject wrong: `Ban`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowDown` and `WrapText` are a
 * prohibition sign, two arrows and a picture of text, borrowed from four
 * unrelated corners of a general-purpose set. Read as a strip they describe
 * four different things, when this control has exactly one subject — where the
 * children of this element end up. The native glyphs draw that subject: the
 * same pair of rounded boxes, moved.
 *
 * `FlowNone` is three boxes scattered rather than a crossed-out anything. "Not
 * laid out" is a real arrangement, not the absence of one, and a `Ban` sign
 * says the control is unavailable rather than that this state is a choice.

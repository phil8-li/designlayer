/**
 * The instance section: which design-system component this element is, and the
 * properties that component declares.
 *
 * Figma's instance-properties block, and it is ONE block because in Figma it is
 * one block. Select an instance there and the right panel answers three
 * questions in a single breath before Layout or Appearance get a word in —
 * which main component is this, what does that component declare, and what is
 * this instance set to. This editor used to answer those from two sections that
 * did not know about each other: `section-variants` read the axes out of the
 * project's own SOURCE and could write them, `section-library-component` read
 * what an installed LIBRARY documents and could write nothing at all. A
 * designer looking at one `<x-button>` therefore got a `Variants` block and a
 * `Library component` block that were visibly about the same thing and
 * disagreed about how much of it was editable. Two sources of truth is the
 * right number to HAVE and the wrong number to SHOW.
 *
 * So: one header, one `Properties` group, rows merged by name. Where the two
 * sources name the same property the source-declared axis wins, because it is
 * the one that can actually be written — the merge rule is stated again at the
 * call site, since that is where it would be broken.
 *
 * `null` when the selection is neither a matched library component nor an
 * instance of a source-declared variant declaration, which is most selections —
 * the contract every section in this directory keeps, and the reason the panel
 * stays as short as the element is simple.
 *
 * ## The two joins, both weak, both the only ones available
 *
 * A source declaration is matched on EVIDENCE: `matchDeclaration` asks which of
 * the file's factories this element is demonstrably wearing the classes of. A
 * library component is matched on NAME and on TAG, because that is all there
 * is — see `libraries/store.ts`, which owns both halves so the rule is stated
 * once rather than re-derived per panel. A false positive on the library half
 * is a panel showing documentation for a same-named component from somewhere
 * else, which is a cost a reader can see and correct.
 *
 * ## What a documented prop can write, and why this section chose what it did
 *
 * A source-declared AXIS is writable and always was: choosing an option swaps
 * the classes that option contributes, `updateClass` lands those on disk, and
 * the note under the rows says it writes the classes and not the prop. None of
 * that changes here.
 *
 * A LIBRARY-documented prop is the open question, and it was investigated on
 * both lanes rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - **React cannot.** The pinned rewrite engine (`react-rewrite-cli@0.1.1`)
 *    has four source operations — `updateClass`, `updateText`, `reorder`,
 *    `moveSpacing` — and not one of them edits a JSX attribute.
 *  - **Angular cannot either, today, and is one wire operation away.**
 *    `AngularOperation` in `core/angular.ts` is `setStyles | setClasses |
 *    setText`; `editsFor` in `server/angular-source.mjs` answers exactly those
 *    three plus `removeElement` and `insertElement`. That server already has a
 *    general `setAttribute` splicer sitting in it, unreachable, because no
 *    operation asks for it. So `variant="primary"` in an Angular template is
 *    genuinely writable in principle and is not writable now, and minting that
 *    operation is a server change this section has no standing to make.
 *
 * What Angular DOES supply is the other half. A component's selector is the DOM
 * tag, and an input written statically in a template — `variant="primary"` —
 * is a real attribute on the real element. That is evidence, and it is the gate
 * this section uses. A documented prop that is PRESENT as an attribute on the
 * selected element gets a control: setting it sets the attribute, which is a
 * live preview any component styling itself off `[variant="primary"]` actually
 * repaints for, and the change is filed through `recordPreviewOnly` so the
 * Changes tab hands it to an agent. A documented prop that is NOT on the
 * element gets no control, because there is nothing to set, and setting it
 * would be inventing markup no file has.
 *
 * That is option (b) wherever the element supplies the evidence and option (a)
 * everywhere else — which on a React host is everywhere, since a React prop
 * leaves no attribute behind. The rows say which they are: a previewed one
 * toasts "— preview only" on every write and appears in Changes, a stated one
 * is printed as text with no control on it at all.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not claim. Setting an attribute does not
 * run Angular's change detection, so a component that reads its input once at
 * construction will not repaint — the attribute moved and the render may not,
 * and "preview only" is the truthful word for both. And nothing reaches `class`
 * or `style` by this path: those have real write lanes, and routing round them
 * would strand an edit that could have reached the file.

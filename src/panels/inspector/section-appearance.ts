/**
 * Appearance — Figma's Layer section: opacity and corner radius.
 *
 * Paint lives in its own Fill / Stroke / Effects sections below, the way Figma
 * splits them, so a row-list affordance never has to share a header with a
 * scalar field.
 *
 * ## The radius token rows moved in, and the second expander went away
 *
 * `corner-radius` and its four per-corner siblings used to be drawn a second
 * time, thirty rows further up, by the `Design system` section — a panel of
 * token pickers for properties other sections already had controls for. That
 * section is gone (see `token-row.ts` for the whole argument), so the radius
 * bindings now sit in the group that already asks the radius question.
 *
 * The merge is not just a move, because the two halves each carried their OWN
 * disclosure. This group's `Grid2x2`/`Square` toggle splits one number into
 * four, and the old section's double chevron unfolded a list that happened to
 * begin with four per-corner token rows. A designer who wanted to set the
 * top-left corner by token therefore had to find and open a DIFFERENT control
 * from the one they had just opened to set it by number, and having opened one
 * there was nothing to say the other existed.
 *
 * So there is one toggle now — `appearance.radius` — and it governs both
 * halves. Folded: the uniform number, and the uniform binding under it.
 * Unfolded: the four numbers, and the four per-corner bindings under them. One
 * decision, asked once, answered in whichever spelling the designer reaches
 * for.
 *
 * The binding is a bare `tokenControl` rather than the captioned `tokenRow`,
 * because the group caption above it already says `Corner radius`; a captioned
 * block here would print that phrase twice in eight vertical pixels. The hints
 * `tokenRow` would have carried come back separately through `tokenHints` —
 * "could be X or Y" is the honesty the picker is built around and is not worth
 * a tidier row.

     *
     * The case for moving it is real. A field label slot holds either a word or
     * a glyph, and in this column the two alternate down the stack:
     * `CornerRadius` here, TL/TR/BR/BL as words underneath. Those words set at
     * 12px/400, whose stems render around 1.0–1.1px, while a `control`-rung
     * glyph strokes at 1.500px — so the glyph labels read about 40% heavier
     * than the worded ones they alternate with, which is a rank nobody
     * designed. `icon.marker` would put them at 1.250px, within ~15%.
     *
     * It cannot be done at the call site, because these are NATIVE glyphs. The
     * hand-drawn family is set out on a grid whose strokes land on whole pixels
     * only at 16, 24 and 32 — `NATIVE_ICON_SIZES` in `core/icons.ts`, with the
     * measurements behind it — and at 12 the same construction resolves to four
     * or six ink levels, which is the soft half-covered edge the family was
     * drawn to remove. `icon-cases.mjs` fails the build on exactly this, by
     * name, and it is right to: a blurrier glyph is a worse answer to
     * "match the stroke to the text" than a heavier one.
     *
     * So the stroke mismatch is real and the fix is not here. It is either a
     * 12px redrawing of the five glyphs this column uses, or a decision that a
     * worded label is the only kind this column gets.

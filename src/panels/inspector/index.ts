/**
 * Right-hand inspector.
 *
 * Three tabs. **Design** is the historical panel: a stack of collapsible
 * sections, each owning one file, each returning `null` when it has nothing to
 * say about the current selection — which keeps the panel as short as the
 * element is simple. **Changes** holds the session's outbox. **Design system**
 * holds the project's libraries and the audit against them.
 *
 * They are tabs rather than more sections because they are not more to scroll
 * past: each is a different thing to be looking at, and two of them own a
 * footer that has to stay put while their body scrolls.
 *
 * ## What came, what went, and why the panel is not "one selection" any more
 *
 * **Code** used to be the third tab and is now in the left rail beside Layers.
 * Both of those answer "what IS this" — one as a position in the page, one as
 * source — and neither is a control you change anything with, which is what
 * this panel is otherwise entirely made of. `panels/left.ts` carries the rest
 * of that argument.
 *
 * **Library** sat second here for a release, left for the left rail, grew into
 * a catalogue of cards and previews there, and has now come back as half of
 * **Design system** — without the catalogue. The thing that was wrong about it
 * as a tab was never the subject, it was the browsing: a grid of four hundred
 * components you scroll through is most useful in the one state a selection
 * panel has nothing to say, and least useful when you have actually selected
 * something. What is here now is the SETTING that argument was always sound
 * about — which libraries this project draws from, and what each one contains —
 * plus the design-system audit, which was the left rail's third tab. The
 * components themselves did not go anywhere: they reach the Design tab through
 * `instanceSection`, which shows a component's properties when you have one
 * selected, which is when they are worth showing.
 *
 * So two of these three tabs are views of the selection and the third is a view
 * of the project. That is a real difference and the strip does not hide it —
 * `tab-design-system.ts` documents why it deliberately does not repaint when
 * the selection moves.
 *
 * `css/inspector.ts` keeps the strip a scroller, and it has to be: "Design
 * system" is a two-word label and the seam drags down to `inspectorMinWidth`,
 * which is 200px. `activate()` below carries the other half, scrolling the
 * chosen tab into view so the keyboard path never depends on a scrollbar that
 * is deliberately not drawn.

   * movement and then denies it, which is what makes a press on one of these
   * headers read as a flicker rather than as something opening.
   *
   * A wrapper, and not a height written onto the body, because the thing being
   * animated is a grid row: see `.de-section-fold` in `css/panels.ts` for why
   * the row goes on a box of its own and the padded body stays inside it. The

   * read as bent, because the titles started on a column nothing else in the
   * body used. Moving it to the trailing edge puts the title back on the 8px
   * the body pads to, and gives the chevrons a column of their own against the
   * panel's right edge.
   *
   * That splits one control across a third thing that has to stay separately
   * clickable: the `+` some sections carry. A `+` nested inside the fold button
   * would be a button inside a button — invalid, and unreachable by keyboard.
   * So the button holds no content at all. It is an empty layer stretched over
   * the whole bar (see `.de-section-toggle`), with the title, the actions and
   * the chevron laid over it as grid items; only the actions take their own

/**
 * Binding one CSS property to a design-system token, as a control any section
 * can drop into a group it already owns.
 *
 * ## Why this is a module and not a section any more
 *
 * It was a section: `Design system`, a stack of thirty labelled pickers — fill
 * colour, text colour, text style, corner radius, shadow, gap, padding — sitting
 * between Component and Position. Every row in it named a CSS property that
 * some OTHER section of the inspector already had a control for, so the panel
 * asked the same question twice in two places and answered it in two different
 * shapes. A designer changing the text colour of a heading met `Text color` in
 * one section and `Color` in another, thirty rows apart, both showing
 * `#1b2e5d`, neither mentioning the other. Which one wrote a token and which
 * one wrote a literal was not discoverable from either.
 *
 * That is the whole reason the section is gone. A token is not a category of
 * design decision — it is an ANSWER to the question a control already asks, and
 * Figma treats it exactly so: the paint row shows the style's name where the hex
 * would be, the type block shows the text style above the size and weight, and
 * there is no "design system" panel anywhere, because every panel is one.
 *
 * So the machinery moved here and the rows moved out, each into the section that
 * owns its property:
 *
 *   fill-color, svg-fill                       -> Fill
 *   text-color, text-style                     -> Typography
 *   stroke-color, ring-color, outline-color,
 *   svg-stroke                                 -> Stroke
 *   corner-radius (+ the four corners)         -> Appearance
 *   shadow, motion-duration                    -> Effects
 *   gap, padding, margin (+ sides and axes)    -> Layout
 *   icon-size                                  -> Icon
 *
 * Nothing about WHAT a row does changed in the move. The matching, the
 * uncertainty hint, the inert-token hint, the custom raw value and the
 * `stocked` rule are the same code, called from a different place.
 *
 * ## The two shapes, and when to use which
 *
 * `tokenRow` is the captioned block the old section drew: a title, the field,
 * and the hints under it. A section reaches for it when the axis has no control
 * of its own — `margin`, a ring colour, a motion duration.
 *
 * `tokenControl` is the bare field, for the case that matters more: a section
 * that ALREADY draws this property folds the binding into its own row, so there
 * is one control rather than two. Fill's paint row puts it where the hex text
 * was; Typography's Color group puts it beside the swatch. When a token is
 * bound the field reads its name, and when none is it reads the plain value —
 * which is the string the control it replaced was showing anyway.
 *
 * Both answer `null` when the design system stocks NO token for the axis, and
 * that is what keeps a project with three colours from growing eight empty
 * pickers. A caller must treat null as "draw your own control and nothing
 * else", which is why every call site passes the result through `el()`'s
 * null-skipping children rather than testing it.

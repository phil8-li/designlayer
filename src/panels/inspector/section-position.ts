/**
 * Position — where the box sits, how it lines up, and its order among siblings.
 *
 * Four groups that answer one question each: align (written on the parent as
 * flex placement — `section-align.ts` holds the reasoning for why not
 * `transform`), distribute (the same write path, spreading the parent's main
 * axis), arrange (the element's order among its JSX siblings, which is what
 * "front" and "back" mean in a document flow — see `core/arrange.ts`), and the
 * measured frame.
 *
 * EVERY ONE OF THEM IS CAPTIONED NOW, and that is the change a reader of this
 * file will notice first. The section used to be four unlabelled rows, which
 * works only for as long as you can identify a group by recognising the marks
 * in it: true of the six align triangles, false of two numbers in a box, where
 * `708` beside `648` says nothing about whether it is a size, a position or a
 * padding. The section header cannot carry that — it names the whole block, and
 * the whole block is the thing with four different answers in it. `group()` is
 * Figma's own small grey label, measured at ~10px in `.harness/figma-spec.md`,
 * which labels every control group in its right panel where ours labelled none.
 *
 * The frame is a READOUT, not a set of fields. X and Y come from the viewport
 * box, which is an outcome of layout rather than an input to it: there is no
 * property to write them back to on a statically-positioned element, and
 * `core/tailwind.ts` cannot express `transform` anyway. Width and height are
 * editable and live in the Layout section, which owns the box's own sizing.

 * about the horizontal axis and those three are not" was a gap whose size
 * depended on how wide the panel had been dragged. `actionGroup` says it in the
 * geometry instead: each triple shares one surface, cut into thirds by a
 * hairline of panel ground, with only the outer corners rounded. `de-row--split`
 * then puts the two of them on the panel's own two-column grid, which is the
 * 88px + 8px + 88px Figma measures its align row at.

 * remember, and ours write `justify-content`/`align-items` on the parent, a
 * setting that stays set. A control that silently holds a value it will not
 * show is the worse failure. `css/panels.ts` draws that state as the segmented
 * control's raised chip so it speaks the panel's one chosen-of-several voice.
 *
 * The `role="toolbar"` sits on the ROW, not on either track: `actionGroup`
 * already marks a triple as a `role="group"`, and the toolbar is what says the
 * six of them are one set of controls rather than two unrelated ones.

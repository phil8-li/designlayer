/**
 * Fill — Figma's paint row list, at the one row CSS actually supports.
 *
 * `background-color` holds a single paint, so the section shows one row rather
 * than pretending a stack exists. What the row model buys is real: a per-fill
 * eye that parks the colour without losing it, and an explicit add/remove
 * instead of "type transparent and hope".
 *
 * ## The token binding is IN the paint row now
 *
 * `fill-color` and `svg-fill` used to be two more rows in a `Design system`
 * section thirty rows further down the panel. That meant the background colour
 * of the selected box was asked about twice — once here as a hex, once there as
 * a token name — in two shapes, neither mentioning the other, and which of them
 * wrote a token was not discoverable from either. Figma has no such section
 * because a token is not a category of decision: it is the ANSWER this row
 * already asks for, printed where the hex would be.
 *
 * So the row's middle cell is the token field. It was an inert `<span>` holding
 * the hex, which is exactly the slot Figma fills with the bound style's name,
 * and the field prints the plain hex itself when nothing is bound — so the swap
 * costs the row nothing and stops the panel asking twice. The swatch beside it
 * still edits the literal. One row, both ways in.
 *
 * `svg-fill` cannot join it. It paints the `<svg>` INSIDE the selected button
 * rather than the button, so it writes to a different element; a single row
 * whose swatch and whose token field disagreed about what they were editing
 * would be worse than two rows.

 *
 * ## The bug this replaces wrote black into people's source
 *
 * It was `toHex(color) ?? "#000000"`. `toHex` understands hex and `rgb()` and
 * nothing else, and Chrome does NOT normalise wide-gamut colours on the way
 * out: an element authored `oklch(0.7 0.15 250)` computes to that same string.
 * So `toHex` returned null, the fallback took over, and dragging the opacity
 * field replaced the designer's colour with **pure black** — at every alpha,
 * including 100%, because the `alpha >= 1` path returned the fallback hex too.
 * Verified in Chrome against `oklch()`, `lab()` and `color(display-p3 …)`.
 *
 * ## What it does now
 *
 * The sRGB path is unchanged, because it is the common one and it round-trips
 * exactly. Anything else is re-stated through relative colour syntax in its own
 * colour space (`restated`), which changes the alpha and touches nothing else.
 *
 * And when even that is not possible — an unrecognised function, a bare keyword
 * — it returns `null` and the caller declines. Refusing to write is the only
 * honest answer for an editor that is about to put a value in somebody's source
 * file: a wrong colour is worse than an unchanged one, because the unchanged
 * one is still what they authored.

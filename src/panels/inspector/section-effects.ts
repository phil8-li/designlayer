/**
 * Effects — the one genuinely stackable paint in CSS.
 *
 * `box-shadow` is a comma list, so this is Figma's row model for real: add,
 * reorder-free stacking, a per-row eye that parks an effect without losing its
 * values, and a remove. Everything is serialised back into one declaration.
 *
 * ## The two token rows that moved in
 *
 * The `Design system` section is gone and its rows went to whichever section
 * owns their property (`token-row.ts` carries the argument). Two landed here.
 *
 * `shadow` is the obvious one and the awkward one — see the comment on the
 * binding below. `motion-duration` is neither: a transition is not an effect in
 * Figma's sense at all, because Figma has no transitions. It is here because
 * this is the only section in the panel about how the box PRESENTS itself
 * rather than where it sits or what it contains, and how long that presentation
 * takes to arrive is the same kind of question as how far the shadow is thrown.
 * The alternative was a `Motion` section holding exactly one row, which is a
 * header, a chevron and a fold state spent on a single select — more panel for
 * less information, and one more place a designer has to look.

   * views of one property, and they cannot both be authoritative — so the panel
   * has to say which wins, and it is the token: picking one replaces the
   * declaration, layers and all, and the cards below redraw as whatever the
   * token turned out to be. Nothing here merges a token into layer three. The
   * parked rows are the one thing that survives it, and should: the eye is a
   * statement about a layer the designer switched off, not about the value that
   * happened to be painted when they did.
   *
   * Placement is how that gets said without a sentence. Under the cards it would
   * read as a fifth field on the last one, and a control that overwrites the
   * four cards above it must not look like it belongs to one of them. Above
   * them, before the list, it reads as what it is: the whole effect, with the
   * per-layer breakdown underneath as the long form of the same answer.

/**
 * One keymap for the editor chrome, and it is Figma's.
 *
 * The guards used to be re-derived in every listener, so a new shortcut was one
 * forgotten `isChrome` away from moving the selected element while the user was
 * arrowing through the layers tree.
 *
 * ## Why Figma's keys and not our own
 *
 * The people using this editor spend their day in Figma. Every key they already
 * know is a key we do not have to teach, and — more to the point — every key we
 * bind DIFFERENTLY from Figma is one they will press by accident for the rest of
 * the session. So the table below is a transcription rather than a design: each
 * row names the Figma command it comes from, and a row exists only where this
 * editor has something that command honestly means here.
 *
 * Three translations are worth stating, because they are the ones a reader will
 * want to argue with:
 *
 *   - **V, C and H are our three modes.** Figma's Move tool selects, its comment
 *     tool pins a note, and its Hand tool is the one state where a click does
 *     not touch the objects underneath. That is exactly `inspecting`,
 *     `annotating` and `interactive` — the mapping is a coincidence of design
 *     rather than a stretch, and it means the mode switch has the keys a
 *     designer already reaches for.
 *   - **A is an alias for V.** In Figma it is the Frame tool. This editor edits
 *     a DOM that already exists and can no more create a frame than it can
 *     create a page, so the key is unclaimed, and it was asked for.
 *   - **⌘] and ⌘[ reorder SOURCE, not z-index.** See `core/arrange.ts`: front is
 *     the first JSX child. In a document flow that is what "bring forward"
 *     means, and z-index is a property this editor cannot write.
 *
 * Nothing is invented. Where Figma has a command and we have nothing to do with
 * it — the pen, the shape tools, zoom, pixel grid — there is no row, because a
 * key that is bound and does nothing is worse than a key that is free: it
 * swallows a keystroke the prototype underneath might have wanted.
 *
 * ## Where the keys are answered
 *
 * `shell/shortcuts.ts` is the only module that listens, and it dispatches
 * through `core/commands.ts`. The canvas lane still answers the five navigation
 * keys itself, because those depend on the selection, the scope and the
 * resolver memo it already holds — so they carry `owner: "canvas"` here. They
 * are in the table anyway: this is the one place that answers "what does this
 * key do?", and a table that omitted Tab because another file handles it would
 * be a table you cannot trust.

/**
 * One chord, described rather than matched by hand.
 *
 * `key` or `code`, never both, and which one is a real decision per row:
 *
 *   - **`key`** is the character the user believes they are typing, so a French
 *     or German layout gets the shortcut where the letter actually is. Every
 *     bare letter uses it, and so does ⌘. — the period is a period wherever the
 *     keyboard keeps it.
 *   - **`code`** is the physical key, and it is what a chord with ⌥ or ⇧ on a
 *     digit or a bracket MUST use. On macOS ⌥8 does not report `"8"`, it
 *     reports `"•"`; ⇧2 reports `"@"`; ⇧\ reports `"|"`. Matching those on
 *     `key` is how a shortcut comes to work on the reviewer's keyboard and
 *     nowhere else.
 *
 * The four modifier flags are EXACT: a flag left off means the modifier must be
 * absent, not that we do not care. That is what lets ⌘] and ⌥⌘] be two commands
 * rather than one that fires twice, and it is why ⌃⌘Z on a Mac falls through to
 * whoever wants it instead of being read as undo.

 * `mod` is the platform accelerator — ⌘ on a Mac, Ctrl everywhere else. `ctrl`
 * is literally Control on both, which only Figma's shortcuts-panel key needs.

 * shortcuts safe to have at all.
 *

 * floating disc the editor is a guest on someone else's page, and the page may
 * well bind `c` or `v` itself — so every row goes quiet except the one marked
 * `whileHidden`, which is ⌘.. That key has to survive: it is the only way back,
 * and unlike a bare letter a platform accelerator is not something a prototype
 * reasonably claims. This is the whole of the "shortcuts only work while the
 * editor is shown" rule, in one place, rather than a `chromeHidden` check

 * Escape's last meaning: stand the editor down to the disc.
 *
 * Escape is not a chord this table can own, because it is already the canvas's
 * deselect and every overlay's close. It is one key with an ESCALATING meaning
 * — close what is open, then clear what is selected, then collapse — and the
 * order is the whole feature: a key that collapsed the editor while a note
 * editor was up, or while something was selected, would be a key nobody could
 * use to deselect. So this answers only the question "is this press a candidate
 * for the last step", and the caller in `shell/shortcuts.ts` is what makes it
 * last: it listens on the BUBBLE phase, after every capture listener in the
 * editor has had the key, and stands down if any of them took it.
 *
 * Two gates of its own, and they are the same two the table's rows get:
 *
 *   - **A collapsed editor does not answer it.** Escape belongs to the page
 *     once the editor is a disc, exactly like the bare letters — and unlike ⌘.
 *     it is a key a prototype reasonably owns, so there is no `whileHidden`
 *     exception here and never should be.
 *   - **Text entry is never ours.** Escape in a field reverts the field, which
 *     is `panels/inspector/field.ts`'s business and not a reason to collapse.

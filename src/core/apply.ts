/**
 * The commit: every path from an on-screen preview to a file on disk.
 *
 * This used to live inside `installToolbar`, as three closures over the bar's
 * own `bridge` and `context`. That was fine while the bar was the only thing
 * that could commit, and it stopped being fine the moment the Changes tab
 * needed the same verb — an editor with two commit buttons that each reach
 * disk their own way is an editor with two subtly different definitions of
 * "applied", and the second one is always the one nobody tested.
 *
 * So the orchestration moved here and the bar calls it. There is exactly one
 * ordering of the three queues, one set of toasts, and one answer to "is
 * anything owed". A surface that wants to commit asks for a committer; it does
 * not reimplement the sequence.
 *
 * What did NOT move is the decision about what a queue contains. The writer
 * still decides whether a change can be spelled in source, the removal queue
 * still holds deletions, the Angular lane still describes elements at commit
 * time. This module only runs them, in the one order that does not corrupt a
 * file, and reports what happened.

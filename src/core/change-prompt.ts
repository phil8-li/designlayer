/**
 * The ledger of changes "Apply to code" cannot write, and the prompt that hands
 * them to an agent instead.
 *
 * Two paths leave this editor. "Apply to code" is the real one: a class change
 * or a text change goes down the wire, jscodeshift rewrites the JSX, the file
 * on disk changes, and no agent is involved. But the translator only speaks in
 * utility classes and text — an icon swap renames nothing in the JSX, and a CSS
 * property with no Tailwind equivalent has nowhere to land. Those changes are
 * real, they are on screen, and the next hot reload eats them.
 *
 * Before this file they were reported as a count in a toast and then lost. Now
 * they accumulate here with enough context to be acted on — file, element,
 * property, from, to — and "Copy change prompts" puts that on the clipboard as
 * markdown an agent can execute. That is the honest split: everything that can
 * be written is written, and only the remainder becomes a prompt.
 *
 * ## Why the ledger is written down
 *
 * All of the above was true of a list that lived only in memory, which made
 * this list the single copy of work nobody had taken yet: the changes are on
 * screen, they are in no file, and the button under the Prompts tab is the only
 * way they leave the browser. Any reload emptied it — an ordinary hot reload
 * already did, silently, and that was a bug before anything else changed.
 *
 * The app chooser turned it from a bug into a certainty. Switching apps kills
 * this editor process and the supervisor starts another bound to the same proxy
 * port, so from the browser's side a switch IS a reload of the same document on
 * the same origin, with no confirmation step in front of it. A designer would
 * have lost every stranded change by clicking a name in a menu.
 *
 * So the ledger is filed per app through `app-scope`, exactly as the notes are.
 * Switching away files these changes under the app they were made in, switching
 * back brings them out, and a hot reload no longer eats anything. There is no
 * `adoptUnscoped` call to go with it because there is nothing to adopt: this
 * list has never been written to storage under any key.

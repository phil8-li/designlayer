 * rendered while the parent is shut, so there is nothing to transition from.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ACHIEVES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT — measured, because the honest answer
 * is "most of the way".
 *
 * The same \`0fr -> 1fr\` the other three folds use, read off the native

 * Chrome renders it and resolves the new row in ONE recalculation, so there is
 * no clean starting value for the \`fr\` to interpolate from: the first frame
 * lands at 77.6 of an eventual 110.4px and only the remaining 30% eases in.
 *
 * That is a real improvement on the hard cut it replaces and it is not the full
 * fold the other three get. Closing it properly means driving the height from
 * JS on a frame boundary, the way \`core/leave.ts\`'s \`revealGroup\` does — which

 * THE "WHY?" DISCLOSURE OPENS, WHERE IT USED TO APPEAR.

 * One of four folds in this chrome built the same way: a control that animates

 * discloses arrives between two frames.
 *
 * Done entirely from the stylesheet, with \`:has()\` reading the state off the
 * body's own \`hidden\` attribute, because the element that owns it lives in a
 * file this sheet does not get to edit. That is a better fit here than the
 * \`revealGroup\` helper anyway: this wrapper is persistent — it is not rebuilt
 * when the fold is toggled — so a declarative rule gets the CLOSE as well, which
 * the imperative helper cannot.
 *
 * \`minmax(0, Xfr)\` rather than a bare \`0fr\`: a bare one resolves to
 * \`minmax(auto, 0fr)\`, whose automatic minimum is the padded box, so a shut
 * fold keeps a band of its own background and animates from that band rather
 * than from nothing.

/**
 * The Libraries section: the installed rows, the add-by-URL CTA and the switch.
 *
 * One sheet for a surface that is almost entirely LISTS OF PLACES in a 260px
 * column, which is what every rule below is really solving for. A library is
 * named by a path or a URL, and neither string has a natural width — so the
 * name shrinks with an ellipsis, the source line truncates and carries itself
 * in a `title`, and the controls beside them are `flex: none` so that a deeply
 * nested token file can never push a remove button off the panel.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE DRAWS A PANEL ANY MORE. This was a tab with a header bar of its
 * own, then a dialog; it is a `section()` on the Design system tab now, so the
 * heading, the fold, the 8px side padding and the gap between rows all come
 * from `.de-section-header` / `.de-section-body` in `css/panels.ts`. Every rule
 * that restated one of those is gone rather than adjusted — a second opinion
 * about a section's padding is how two sections in one column end up a pixel
 * apart.
 *
 * The depth grammar is three rungs and it carries meaning rather than
 * decoration: the local-file fold is a WELL (`bgSunken`) because it is a drawer
 * that opened inside the section, an enabled library is a RAISED card because
 * it is contributing to every picker on the Design tab right now, and a
 * disabled one drops back to the panel ground. That last step is the second
 * channel on the switch — where the knob is, and whether the card it sits on is
 * still there — so the on state survives greyscale and a glance.

/**
 * The local-file drawer, and the one container in this sheet that holds a

 *
 * Everything else here is a card in a flat list — the section body spaces them
 * and nothing sits inside anything. The drawer is different: it is a well with
 * bordered candidate rows stacked in it and a path field across its foot, so
 * its top corners hold a `.de-lib-candidate` and its bottom corners hold a
 * `.de-lib-field` and a `.de-button`. Three rounded things in four corners, and
 * `nest()` is what stops them being three separate guesses.
 *
 * `radius.lg` over `space.sm` rather than the `radius.md` over `space.md` this
 * started as, and the inset is what was actually wrong. Two of those three
 * children are SHARED furniture drawn at `radius.md` by rules this sheet does
 * not own, so the only inset that leaves them concentric is one that computes
 * back to `md` — 12 − 4 = 8. An 8px inset would have demanded they all square
 * off, which is a stack of hard-cornered cards in a soft-cornered well, and the
 * `.de-lint-ignored-row` note in `test/concentric-cases.mjs` records the same
 * call being made the same way: move the container, not the shared child.
 *
 * It also lands the drawer on exactly the geometry `.de-app-menu` and
 * `.de-layer-menu` already use, which is the right company — all three are a
 * soft container holding a short list of rows.

 * is the one thing they can compare from memory, so `radius['2xl']` is taken
 * from that sheet rather than chosen again. What differs is what reaches a
 * corner — the sheet's is a `radius.sm` close button, this card's is the primary
 * `.de-button` at `radius.md` — so the INSET is what gives: 20 − 12 = 8 is the
 * only pairing that leaves the two curves parallel without asking shared
 * furniture to move, the same call `.de-lib-panel` above makes.
 *
 * That buys 12 where the sheet spends 16, and it is the right way round anyway:
 * this is a short form at 420px and that is a two-column reference at 760, so
 * the air ought to scale with the surface. 12 is also the step the panel's own
 * sections breathe at, which is the company this card actually keeps.
 *
 * The hairline is counted in, so the rule pads 11 and the border makes the gap

/*
 * THE FOLD ITSELF, AND IT USED TO BE HALF AN ANIMATION.
 *
 * The twisty above turns over 120ms and the thing it discloses arrived between
 * two frames, which is the worst of both: the mark says a drawer is opening and
 * the drawer says it was always there. The words under the twisty promise a
 * movement the body never made.
 *
 * ## Why a grid row and not \`revealGroup\`
 *
 * \`core/leave.ts\` has the helper, and the inspector's disclosure groups use it.
 * Its own header says what it is for: a group that is REBUILT on every render,
 * where the collapsed state has to be written inline at build time because the
 * node is new. This drawer is the opposite — it is built once at mount and
 * lives for the session, which is exactly the case that comment names as the
 * declarative one's. Three things follow from taking it:
 *
 *  - it closes as well as it opens. \`revealGroup\` animates one direction, so
 *    the fold would still snap shut under a twisty turning smoothly back;
 *  - the drawer's contents CHANGE while it is open — a scan lands, rows are
 *    added, a candidate flips to Added — and \`1fr\` re-resolves to whatever the
 *    panel is now. A measured pixel height would have to be measured again;
 *  - no JavaScript runs on the fold at all, so there is no second timer to keep
 *    in step with the reduced-motion clamp.
 *
 * The clip is on this element and not on the panel because the panel is padded,
 * and a border-box squeezed to zero still paints its padding.
 *
 * ## \`minmax(0, 0fr)\`, and it is not a flourish
 *
 * A bare \`0fr\` track means \`minmax(auto, 0fr)\`, and that automatic minimum is
 * the item's own minimum contribution — which for a padded box is its padding
 * plus its margin however small you make its content. Measured in Chrome: the
 * shut fold kept a twelve-pixel band of sunken background under the toggle, the
 * four pixels of margin and the eight of padding, and the drawer animated
 * between 12px and its full height rather than between nothing and it. Naming
 * a floor of zero is what makes the track free to actually close; the panel's
 * own \`min-height: 0\` is the other half and is just as load-bearing.

 * Both attributes are written in the same statement, so either would work
 * today. This one keeps the disclosure's drawing tied to the disclosure's
 * STATE: \`hidden\` is what the panel is, \`aria-expanded\` is what the button
 * claims about it, and if those two ever drift the box should follow the thing
 * that decides whether the controls inside can be reached.
 *
 * \`base\` rather than \`drawer\`, in spite of the name: \`drawer\` is the 240ms a
 * whole panel takes to cross the screen edge, and this is a disclosure opening
 * inside a section — the same statement \`.de-entering\` in \`css/base.ts\` makes

 * over an empty box — which is also exactly what a request that died looks
 * like. The sentence cannot be the whole answer: it is identical on the first
 * frame and the last, so it reports that a scan is HAPPENING and never that it
 * is getting anywhere.
 *
 * A sweep rather than a count, and that is a limit rather than a preference.
 * \`discoverLibraries\` is a single GET that resolves with the finished list, so
 * there is no file tally on this side of the wire to print; a number invented
 * here would be a progress bar that knows nothing about the progress.
 *
 * The drawing is the lint panel's, down to the six base rungs and the ink: an
 * indeterminate loop has no duration to be correct about, so it takes the
 * ramp's slowest step multiplied rather than a literal, and it is the surface's
 * own border colour rather than a hue of its own — a progress mark that
 * introduces a new colour reads as a state change, which is the one thing this
 * is not.
 */
/*
 * THE SIGN-IN DIALOG'S WAIT RIDES THE SAME RULE, by name rather than in a rule
 * of its own, and there are two reasons for that.
 *
 * The first is that they are the same idea. Both are an indeterminate wait with
 * a sentence over it and no number available to either — the scan is one GET
 * that answers with a finished list, and the sign-in is one POST that answers
 * once a person has finished typing their password somewhere else. Two sweeps
 * drawn by two rules would drift, and the editor would grow two dialects of
 * "working on it".
 *
 * The second is the motion budget. \`tools/motion-budget.mjs\` counts infinite
 * animations, and it counts them because each one runs forever on somebody
 * else's page: five is the ceiling and five is what this chrome spends. Adding
 * a selector to the existing declaration costs none — the same animation on one
 * more element — where a second rule would have spent the sixth.
 *
 * The sign-in's mark is on the SENTENCE rather than on its button, unlike the
 * scan's, because during a wait that button is not on screen: the offer is
 * withdrawn and a cancel stands in its place. The line that is reporting is the
 * line that should be moving.

/**
 * Audit markers: the plate on a violating element, and the frame around it.
 *
 * This sheet has one job that matters more than how it looks, and it is stated
 * here because no single rule below can carry it: an audit badge and a note pin
 * must be told apart by a reader who cannot tell amber from red.
 *
 * Both marks are anchored to the TOP-LEFT corner of an element — that is the
 * one corner every box has in the same place at any size — so on a page showing
 * both they would sit on each other rather than beside each other. The layers
 * are therefore exclusive, which `MarkerLayer` in `annotations/store.ts`
 * enforces; but exclusivity only stops them colliding, it does not help the
 * user who switches between them and has to know which one they are looking at.
 *
 * So the distinction is carried by SHAPE, not by hue:
 *
 *   - a note pin is a ROUND disc with a NUMERAL in it, in the user's colour;
 *   - an audit badge is a SQUARE with rounded corners carrying a GLYPH.
 *
 * Shape survives greyscale, a monochrome display, and every colour-vision
 * deficiency there is, and it survives the one case a hue rule cannot survive
 * at all: the note colour is the USER's, and nothing here may assume they did
 * not pick amber. Hue is then free to do the job it is actually good at, which
 * is severity at a glance — `lintWarning` for a warning, `danger` for an error.
 *
 * Severity carries a second channel too, for the same reason one level down:
 * amber against red is exactly the pair a deuteranope cannot separate, so the
 * error plate is squarer than the warning plate. A 4px corner and an 8px corner
 * on a 20px square is a difference you can see across the room, and it is the
 * only difference that is still there in a screenshot printed in black ink.

 * square of the same size as a disc reads as BIGGER, because a square has more
 * area at equal width. Taking two off puts the two marks on the same apparent
 * size, so switching layers does not look like the page changed scale.
 *
 * 12 is `icon.row`, the ramp's dense rung, which is the largest glyph that
 * leaves a ring of plate visible around it at 20px. A glyph that touched the
 * corners would erase the corner radius, and the corner radius is the channel

/*
 * The plate.
 *
 * A border rather than an inset shadow, which is the opposite of what the note
 * pin does, and the reason is the shape again. The pin's edge is an inset
 * hairline so the disc's boundary curves away rather than being a ring drawn on
 * top of it; a square has no curve to preserve, and a real border is what makes
 * the corner radius crisp at 4px. \`bg\` for the border colour, not a tint of the
 * severity: the plate sits on product pixels of an unknown colour, and a band
 * of the chrome's own ground is what separates it from them whatever they are.
 *
 * The glyph is \`onSemantic\`, the ink for a fill that carries a MEANING rather
 * than the accent. It flips with the theme, and so must it: the severity hues
 * are pale in dark and deep in light, precisely so each reads as ink on its own
 * ground, so an ink that stayed put would be wrong on one of the two.
 *
 * This said \`onAccent\` and argued the opposite — "the plate's fill is a
 * severity and does not flip with the theme, so neither may its ink." The
 * premise was already false when it was written, and the conclusion put a white
 * glyph on an amber plate at 1.78:1. \`onSemantic\` is 9.75:1 there. See the
 * role's note in \`tokens.ts\` for the table.

/**
 * The app chooser: the header row at the top of the left panel, and the floating
 * card it opens.
 *
 * Two surfaces in one module because they are one control. The trigger is the
 * only thing on screen that names the app every other panel is a view of, and
 * the menu is the chooser itself — the rows are the running prototypes and
 * clicking one switches the editor to it. Splitting them would put half a
 * control's measurements in a file that never mentions the other half.
 *
 * ## Why the menu is a fixed card with a z-index rather than overlay furniture
 *
 * The other floating surfaces in this chrome divide into two kinds. Canvas
 * chrome — the selection frame, the layer stack, the drop indicator — lives in
 * `.de-overlay-layer`, which `css/base.ts` pins at `z-index: 1`, BELOW the rail
 * holding the panels. That is right for anything drawn over the app and wrong
 * for anything drawn over a panel: the overlay's z-index makes it a stacking
 * context, so a card inside it can never paint above the opaque panel it drops
 * out of, whatever it asks for.
 *
 * The second kind is a popover opened from a panel control — `.de-asset-details`
 * in `css/assets.ts`, `.de-token-popover` in `css/token-picker.ts` — which is
 * `position: fixed` in `document.body` with a z-index above `.de-root`. This
 * menu is the second kind, and shares their vocabulary exactly: `bgRaised` on
 * the `lg` corner, a hairline, and `shadow.popover`. A designer should not be
 * able to tell from the surface which lane built the card.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * Registered after `left-tabs.ts` and before the overlay's modules. The trigger
 * is the left panel's first child and sits directly above the tab strip that
 * file lays out, so the two read as a pair; the menu declares its own stacking
 * outright rather than relying on where in the sheet it lands.
 */

 * rather than incidental: those popovers are opened from a control INSIDE a

 *
 * \`space.md\`, and the step it replaces is the reason to name the failure here
 * rather than fix it silently: this read \`space.sm\`, which is 4, so the ceiling
 * came out \`100vh - 8px\` against a card positioned 8px off each edge. The card

/**
 * Placement chrome: the drop indicator and the drag ghost.
 *
 * Two marks, and they are drawn for two different moments of one gesture. The
 * indicator answers "where will this land" and is the only thing on screen that
 * can answer it, because the element itself does not appear until the source
 * write lands and the dev server re-renders — see the header of
 * `src/libraries/insert.ts` for why that delay is deliberate and not a bug. The
 * ghost answers "what is in my hand", which the cursor alone cannot.
 *
 * Both sit in `.de-overlay-layer`, which `css/canvas.ts` already declares as
 * `pointer-events: none`, and both re-declare it anyway. That is not belt and
 * braces for its own sake: the indicator is painted UNDER THE POINTER during a
 * drag, and the very next thing the drag does is hit-test that same point. An
 * indicator that took the pointer would make `elementsFromPoint` return the
 * indicator, the resolver would discard it as chrome, and the drop target would
 * flicker between the real container and nothing as the pointer moved across
 * its own mark. Losing the overlay's declaration would be silent everywhere
 * else in the chrome and immediately visible here, so the guarantee is restated
 * where it is load-bearing.
 *
 * No z-index, for the reason `css/canvas.ts` records: `css/base.ts` orders the
 * overlay layer against the toolbar and the panels, and a z-index declared in a
 * module concatenated after it would win on cascade order and quietly lift a
 * drop indicator over the panels it must never cover.

 * Accent rather than the guide pink that snapping uses. Both are transient

 * alignment the page ALREADY has, while this reports a change the editor is

 *
 * This is the one case where a line would be a lie: there is no gap between two
 * things to point at, and a 2px rule floating in the middle of an empty box
 * reads as "between these children" when there are none. An outline says the
 * true thing — the component is going INSIDE this — and it is the same shape
 * the selection chrome uses for "this element", so it needs no explaining.
 *
 * The fill is \`selectionSurface\` for the reason \`css/canvas.ts\` gives on the
 * marquee: \`accentSoft\` is an opaque row band, and this mark is painted over
 * the product. An empty container is empty of ELEMENTS, not of pixels — it
 * still has the app's own background, its padding, whatever a pseudo-element
 * put there — and an opaque slab over it is the editor deciding you do not need
 * to see where the thing is going to land.

 * nothing whatsoever has changed, which is indistinguishable from a drop that
 * missed. The mark stays put and breathes so that window reads as "working"
 * rather than as "nothing happened", and the toast carries the words.
 *
 * A 1.1s cycle rather than something faster: this is a progress hint, not
 * feedback on an action, and a quick pulse over someone's live page is
 * agitation. \`prefers-reduced-motion\` drops to a flat mid-opacity, which still

 * \`clientX\`/\`clientY\` with no rect subtraction anywhere, and fixed is the
 * coordinate space those numbers are already in. Capped in both directions
 * because a component's preview can be a full-width banner, and a ghost wider
 * than the canvas hides the page it is being dropped onto.

 * opaque reads as an element that has already been placed.

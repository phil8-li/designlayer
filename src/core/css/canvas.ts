/*
 * WHY GEOMETRY IS INSTANT HERE AND OPACITY IS NOT.
 *
 * This was a flat \`transition: none\`, undocumented, and half of it is
 * load-bearing: \`selection.ts\` re-reads every rect and rewrites \`transform\`,
 * \`width\` and \`height\` on this node EVERY FRAME, because the app underneath
 * animates with Motion (see that file's header). A transition on any of those
 * would make the outline trail the element it is outlining by its own duration,
 * and trail the pointer for the whole of a drag. Those four properties must
 * never enter the list below.
 *
 * \`opacity\` is the one property the frame loop never writes, so it is the one
 * that can carry the appear/disappear the flat rule was also suppressing — the
 * editor's single most repeated state change, previously a cut between two
 * frames with nothing to say it had happened.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS, measured rather than assumed.
 *
 * A transition list on a node whose style is rewritten every frame is not free:
 * the engine must consider, on every mutation, whether a transition should
 * start. On a 16-node overlay at 350 paint cycles per sample, in Chrome:
 *
 *     no transition                      0.0246ms / frame
 *     opacity only                       0.0431ms  (+75%)
 *     opacity + display allow-discrete   0.0394ms  (+60%)
 *
 * So the cost is having a list AT ALL, not \`display\` or \`allow-discrete\`
 * specifically — which is exactly what the flat \`transition: none\` this
 * replaced was protecting.
 *
 * It is kept because of the other half of the measurement: the whole painter
 * frame — eight \`getBoundingClientRect\` reads plus all sixteen writes — costs
 * 0.089ms, which is 0.5% of a 60fps budget. The fade is 0.3% of a frame, spent
 * on the state change this editor makes more than any other. That is a good
 * trade at this size and it stops being one if the overlay grows by an order of
 * magnitude, so the numbers are here rather than in a commit message.
 *
 * \`display\` rides along with \`allow-discrete\` so the fade plays in both
 * directions. Without it the browser tears the node out of the box tree on the
 * first frame of the exit and the fade plays to nobody; with it the used value
 * is held back until the transition finishes, while \`style.display\` still reads
 * as the value the painter wrote. \`exit\` is the rung: fast enough that a
 * selection still feels like it lands on the click, slow enough not to be a
 * flicker.

 * THE MODIFIER PREVIEW'S DIP, AND WHY IT IS A CLASS AND NOT AN INLINE WRITE.

 * with no pointer movement to carry the change, the outline jumped from the
 * shallow element's box to the deep one's between two frames. A jump nobody
 * asked for reads as a glitch rather than as an answer to the key.
 *
 * What can be done about it is bounded by the constraint this whole file is
 * built around: \`canvas/selection.ts\` rewrites this node's \`transform\`,
 * \`width\` and \`height\` EVERY animation frame, so the geometry cannot be
 * transitioned at any price — only \`opacity\` can. So the outline dips to zero,
 * is moved while there is nothing on screen to see it move, and comes back:
 * two \`exit\` fades around a reposition that is still instantaneous.
 *
 * A CLASS rather than an inline \`opacity: 0\`, because the frame loop clears
 * this node's inline opacity on every frame it paints — \`setShown\` writes the
 * empty string precisely so each variant can state its own resting value — so
 * an inline dip would be wiped about one frame after it was written. Both
 * classes are named in the selector so it outranks \`.de-outline--hover\`'s
 * \`opacity: 1\` whichever order the two rules end up in.

 * STANDING DOWN IS A DIFFERENT DEPARTURE FROM BEING DESELECTED, AND THE TIMING
 * IS THE ONLY THING THAT SAYS SO.
 *
 * \`exit\` above is right for the reason it is argued there: a frame that is
 * gone because the thing it outlined is no longer selected should be gone on
 * the click. Hiding the whole editor is not that gesture. The panels leave over
 * \`resize\` after waiting ${STAND_DOWN_DELAY} (see \`css/panels.ts\`) and the toolbar fades
 * over \`hover\`, so a selection frame leaving at \`exit\` had vanished before the
 * panels had even started moving — two halves of one gesture disagreeing about
 * whether anything was happening at all.
 *
 * Scoped to the hidden class rather than carried on a class the painter writes,
 * because the painter does not know WHY it is standing down and should not have
 * to: \`hideAll()\` in \`canvas/selection.ts\` is the same call for both reasons.
 * The stylesheet already knows, because \`html.designlayer-chrome-hidden\` is
 * the one state in which a surface is going somewhere.
 *
 * INTERACTIVE MODE IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THIS SELECTOR. Nothing slides then —
 * the panels and the bar stay exactly where they are — and the mode's whole
 * claim is that the editor is not standing between the pointer and the app,
 * which an outline lingering over a page the user is already clicking through
 * is the one thing that would disprove. That exit keeps \`exit\`.
 *
 * \`opacity\` and \`display\` only, and that is not relaxed by the longer duration
 * — it is made stricter by it. \`canvas/selection.ts\` rewrites \`transform\`,
 * \`width\` and \`height\` on every one of these nodes EVERY animation frame, so
 * any of those in a transition makes the overlay trail the element it outlines
 * by the whole length of the transition, which here would be the delay plus
 * \`resize\`. \`display\` carries the same delay so the node is held in the box
 * tree for the entire fade rather than being torn out while it is still
 * running, and the sum matches the \`visibility\` flip the panels wait for.
 *
 * Guides, badges and the marquee are left out on purpose. Each belongs to a
 * live gesture — a drag, an alt-hover — and no gesture survives the editor
 * being hidden, so a slower exit there would only leave a measurement hanging
 * over an app that no longer has an editor on it.

 * So the default keeps \`accentFillText\` (white on indigo, 4.97:1 dark and

 * length mid-drag, three-quarters of the 12px floor was. \`body\` is the nearest
 * rung that exists, and the argument this comment used to make for moving that
 * rung off 11 has since been taken: it is 12px now.
 *
 * The line box is the shell's own \`leadingRow\` rather than the flat \`16px\` it

 * line of text in the editor — said by naming the role instead of by copying

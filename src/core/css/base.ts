 * Where the palette is DECLARED, and why it is not on the editor root alone.
 *
 * The obvious selector is `[data-designlayer]`, and it is wrong twice over.
 *
 * ONE: `el()` stamps that attribute on everything it builds — 1604 elements in
 * a live session — so declaring the palette on the bare attribute re-declares
 * it on every descendant, and a directly matching declaration beats an
 * inherited one at any specificity. Flipping the theme on the root would then
 * change the root and nothing inside it. That is the same bug the `color` split
 * below documents, with the whole palette instead of one property.
 *
 * TWO: the chrome is not one subtree. Four roots are mounted on `<body>` — the
 * editor root, the options window, the token popover, and the probe span in
 * `inspector/section-design-system.ts` — and `<html>` is the only ancestor all
 * four share. A palette declared on the editor root leaves a popover dark on a
 * light page, and popovers are precisely where the inline `var()` styles in
 * `inspector/color.ts` and `inspector/section-classes.ts` are read.
 *
 * So the values are declared on `:root`, where everything in the document can
 * inherit them, and the theme attribute is written to BOTH `<html>` and the
 * editor root by `applyTheme` in `shell/toolbar.ts`. Naming both selectors
 * means the scoped switch is real rather than decorative: the editor root
 * subtree resolves from its own attribute, and a surface parked outside it
 * falls back to the document's. One writer, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * Dark is emitted first and unconditionally — the theme the editor has always
 * been, and the one it falls back to if the attribute is never written at all,
 * which is what a browser with storage blocked and a boot that threw would

/*
 * THE TYPOGRAPHIC DECISIONS THAT BELONG TO THE WHOLE CHROME, NOT TO A
 * COMPONENT.
 *
 * Face and size are obvious. The rest are here because each of them is a
 * property that is wrong the moment a second rule declares it.
 *
 * SMOOTHING is the pair \`better-typography\` names: "apply
 * \`-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased\` and \`-moz-osx-font-smoothing:
 * grayscale\` once on the root layout, never per component". Only the first half
 * was here, which is the half Chromium and WebKit read — so on macOS Firefox
 * the entire chrome kept subpixel antialiasing and rendered a visible notch
 * heavier than the same build in Safari. One declaration, one browser, and the
 * whole frame around the product a different weight in it.
 *
 * TABULAR FIGURES, and this is the one that is a judgement rather than a
 * transcription, so it is argued rather than asserted.
 *
 * The rule is "tabular-nums on any value that changes". Taken literally that is
 * a per-component decision, and it had been taken that way: nine rules across
 * eight files each declared it for one span, and the list of what they covered
 * — the canvas badge, a numeric input, the tab count, the note index, the saved
 * tally, a library count, a token detail, the selection count — is a list of
 * the numbers somebody happened to be looking at when they noticed. The ones
 * left out are the same kind of thing: the lint group's count, the summary
 * line's issue total, an options folder's "12 controls · 3 choices", every
 * button whose label counts what it is about to act on.
 *
 * That split is not a hierarchy, it is coverage, and coverage is what a root
 * declaration is for. This chrome is an instrument panel: essentially every
 * numeral it prints is a measurement, a coordinate, a count or a port, and
 * essentially every one of them is rewritten in place while the reader watches.
 * The cost on the other side is real and small — proportional digits inside a
 * sentence of prose set marginally better — and a 240px panel of 12px type is
 * not where that difference is spent.
 *
 * So it is declared once and the nine per-component copies are gone. What is
 * NOT redundant is the rule below: a form control gets the UA's \`font\`
 * shorthand, which resets \`font-variant\` to normal, so an \`<input>\` does not
 * inherit this no matter where it sits.
 *
 * LEADING is \`type.leadingRow\` and is unitless for the reason argued on the
 * token: a flat \`16px\` here inherited onto the \`micro\` rung as 1.6 and onto
 * \`body\` as 1.33, which is under the 1.4 floor for anything that wraps — and
 * eleven rules in \`css/\` had already opted out of it to say so.
 *
 * WRAPPING, last, and root-level for a reason specific to this surface.
 *
 * \`text-wrap: pretty\` keeps a single short word off the final line. The usual
 * caution is to put it on descriptions and keep it out of long-form text,
 * because browsers spend real layout work on a long paragraph and evening one
 * out is not worth it. There is no long-form text in this chrome. The longest
 * run anywhere in it is a three-line hint in a 240px panel, and there are
 * perhaps thirty such runs — every one of them a description in the sense the
 * rule means, and every one of them at a width where a one-word last line is a
 * third of the box wasted.
 *
 * So the alternative to one inherited declaration is thirty, added one at a
 * time by whoever next notices an orphan. It costs nothing where it does not
 * apply: a single-line label has no final line to fix, and a rule that sets
 * \`white-space: nowrap\` or \`pre\` keeps its mode (see the note on the rule).
 * Headings that want \`balance\` instead say so locally — \`.de-empty\` below is
 * the one place in the chrome that does.

 * The UA's own button padding, gone — once, here, rather than in each rule that
 * remembers.
 *
 * Chrome ships \`padding: 1px 6px\` on every \`<button>\`. Every icon button in
 * this chrome then pins an explicit square — 18, 24, 32 — and with
 * \`border-box\` those twelve horizontal pixels come out of the CONTENT box, so
 * a 32px tool is really 20px wide inside and an 18px mini is really 6px. The
 * note-row actions are what this cost: a 16px glyph in a 6px box, drawn 4x16.
 *
 * Fixing that per rule is the arrangement that produced it. Three of the ten
 * icon-button classes had remembered \`padding: 0\` and the rest had not, and
 * nothing distinguishes the two groups except which one somebody had already
 * been bitten by. Resetting here means an icon button is square by default and
 * a control that genuinely wants padding says so — which every text button in
 * the chrome already does, because the UA's 6px was never enough for one.
 *
 * Wrapped in \`:where()\` so it weighs nothing. \`[data-designlayer] button\` is
 * (0,1,1) — heavier than the (0,1,0) of every \`.de-\` class in this stylesheet
 * — so as a plain selector this would not remove the UA's padding, it would
 * overrule the deliberate padding on every text button in the chrome. A reset
 * has to be the thing everything else beats.

/* Glyphs are decorative and live inside buttons. Leaving them hit-testable

/*
 * \`flex: none\` is the guard that makes a squashed glyph impossible.
 *
 * Every icon button in this chrome is a flex container, so its \`<svg>\` is a
 * flex item, and a flex item's default \`min-width: auto\` does not protect a
 * replaced element the way it protects text — the browser will happily shrink a
 * 16px glyph to 4px to fit a content box that some other rule made too narrow.
 * That is exactly what a forgotten UA \`padding: 1px 6px\` did to the note-row
 * actions: 4x16, drawn as a smear, and nothing anywhere reported an error.
 *
 * With this, the same mistake overflows instead. An icon spilling past its
 * button is seen by the first person who looks at the screen; an icon quietly

 * Here rather than in each sheet because it is one idea. The alternative is
 * what the chrome already had too much of — the same pattern solved separately
 * in \`annotations.ts\` and \`libraries.ts\`, free to drift apart by a rung.
 *
 * \`height\` is animated from a value \`core/leave.ts\` measures and pins one frame
 * earlier: a row's height is its content's, so there is nothing for CSS alone
 * to animate from. Everything that contributes vertical space goes to zero with
 * it — padding, borders and the flex gap the list sets — or the row leaves
 * behind a few pixels of nothing. \`overflow: hidden\` keeps the contents from
 * spilling as the box closes, and \`pointer-events: none\` means a row on its way
 * out cannot take a second click.
 *
 * The blanket above clamps all of this to 0.01ms under reduced motion, which is

 * THERE IS NO MATCHING EXIT, AND THAT IS A FINDING RATHER THAN AN OMISSION.

 * contract that says the opposite: the shortcuts sheet and the layer menu are
 * on the Escape stack, where a surface still present absorbs the next
 * dismissal; the options window owes its opener the focus back; the annotation
 * composer is asserted gone the moment a note is saved. Deferring the removal
 * broke twelve cases across four surfaces, and in two of them it was a real
 * input hazard rather than a test being strict.
 *
 * A \`.de-arrive--fade\` rule and its \`de-arrive-fade\` keyframe sat here for a
 * while afterwards, unreferenced, as a signpost. A rule nobody applies is still
 * bytes in every editor's stylesheet and a name a sweep has to rule on twice,
 * so the signpost is these words and the CSS has gone.
 *
 * Done properly, an exit means removing the node at once and playing the
 * animation on a ghost in a pointer-inert layer — so that "closed" and "still
 * painted" stop being the same question. That is a layer this chrome does not
 * have, and inventing one to fade four cards is a poor trade.

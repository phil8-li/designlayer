 * As tall as the toolbar, pinned 32 off the corner.

 * The size WAS Agentation's 44, to the pixel, and that was the wrong thing to
 * copy here. Their disc is the whole of their chrome; ours is one of two states
 * of a bar that is 40 tall, and 44 beside 40 is not a deliberate contrast —
 * it is near enough to read as the same size and far enough to look wrong the
 * moment you collapse the editor while watching the corner. Taking the bar's
 * height outright makes the two states one object: the strip you were using
 * becomes a disc of exactly its height, so the only thing that changed is the
 * width. It is also the smaller of the two numbers, which is what the disc
 * wants — it sits over someone else's product doing nothing until it is needed.
 *
 * It stays a comfortable target: 40px clears the 24px minimum of WCAG 2.2
 * Target Size (Minimum) with room to spare, and is the size Material gives a
 * small FAB, which is the same object under another name.
 *
 * Imported rather than restated, so a change to the bar's padding or its
 * squares carries here instead of leaving a disc that used to match.
 *
 * The inset is not Agentation's — theirs is 20, and this sat at 20 to match
 * until the disc was looked at against a real app. A circle 20px off two edges
 * reads as crowding the corner it is in; 32 gives it the air to read as
 * floating OVER the product rather than stuck to it, and it clears the
 * scrollbars and corner affordances that live in exactly that corner on the
 * pages this editor is pointed at.
 *
 * Kept in agreement with `EDGE` in `shell/launcher.ts`, which is the margin a
 * DRAGGED disc clamps to — a dragged surface has to be able to land exactly
 * where an undragged one sits, or the resting position is somewhere the user
 * cannot choose.

 * three curves is three events". That argument is about the surfaces LEAVING,
 * and for those two it still holds — the bar fades and the panels slide, both
 * on \`ease\`, and neither has anything to overshoot. The disc is not one of
 * them. It is the only thing on screen ARRIVING, it starts after the other two
 * are already going (\`${ARRIVE_DELAY}\`), and it is a ${SIZE}px object landing in an
 * empty corner rather than a value settling into place.
 *
 * Which is verbatim what \`tokens.ts\` says \`easeSpring\` is for: "the one thing
 * that should feel like an object arriving rather than a value changing: the
 * launcher popping in". For as long as this rule said \`ease\`, that comment
 * described a call site that did not exist and the token had none anywhere in
 * the codebase. One of the two had to move, and the token's reasoning is the
 * better one.
 *
 * The SCALE takes the spring and nothing else does. \`opacity\` stays on \`ease\`
 * because an overshooting curve on a value that clamps at 1 buys a flat hold
 * and no bounce; \`background\` stays because a hover tint has nothing to
 * overshoot; and the exit above stays because a disc that sprang on the way OUT

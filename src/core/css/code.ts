 * One row per logical line, numbered in a gutter, wrapping in place.

 * A 260px panel cannot show a JSX line: at 1440x900 a data-URI src and a
 * sentence of body copy both ran off the right edge with nothing to say they
 * had. Wrapping is the only way the content is all readable, and once a line
 * can occupy several rows it needs a number to still read as one line — which
 * is what open-pencil's view does too.
 *
 * The number is ::before content, so selecting the view and copying it takes
 * the code and leaves the gutter behind. It counts lines in THIS view, not in
 * the file; the file's own line is in the header beside the name.

 * worry was that a palette picked for the old one had gone flat. It went the
 * other way: every tint gained about 2 points of contrast because the ground
 * dropped, and the set now runs 9.8:1 (number) to 13.2:1 (string), with
 * punctuation the floor at 6.8:1. Nothing here needs re-cutting, and the note
 * is the useful part — the next person to move the ground should re-measure
 * rather than re-derive, and the value that goes first is the punctuation.

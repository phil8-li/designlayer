/**
 * Chrome tokens for the editor UI.
 *
 * SOURCE: the design foundations kit (`css/palette.css`, `css/tokens.css`,
 * `tokens/tokens.ts`). The editor adopts its treatment — the cool neutral
 * family, the near-white ladder, the chrome-wash ladder, the indigo focus and
 * selection hue, the radius ladder and squircle corners, the elevation recipes
 * and the motion vocabulary — while keeping its own DENSITY: 12px UI text and
 * 24px rows, because it is a Figma-style editor packed into two 240px columns,
 * not a product page. Every value below names the kit role it came from.
 *
 * Values are vendored as literals rather than read from a stylesheet. The
 * package contract is that nothing here imports the host app and nothing in
 * the app imports this, so the coupling is the comment naming each source role.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO THEMES, AND WHY THE COLOURS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT MOVES
 *
 * Everything in `color`, `code` and `shadow` below is a REFERENCE —
 * `var(--de-color-bg)` rather than a literal. The values live in `PALETTE`, two
 * per role, and `css/base.ts` emits them as two blocks of custom properties
 * switched by `data-de-theme`. The css modules interpolate these tokens once,
 * at build time, so a reference is the only shape that lets one stylesheet
 * resolve differently per theme.
 *
 * `icon`, `size`, `type`, `radius`, `space`, `duration` and `ease` stay
 * literal: several are read by JavaScript as numbers, and none varies by theme.

/* ---------- concentric corners ---------- */

/**
 * A container's padding and its children's radius, derived together.
 *
 * Two rounded rectangles, one inside the other, look WRONG unless their corners
 * share a centre. The rule is the offset-curve one: move a curve of radius R
 * inward by p and you get a curve of radius R − p, clamped at zero because a
 * corner cannot bend backwards. So the inner radius is not a taste decision and
 * it is not a step to be picked off the scale — it FALLS OUT of the outer
 * radius and the distance between the two shapes.
 *
 * The clamp is the whole edge case: once the inset reaches the radius, the
 * corner has been eroded away and the child is square. Past that point the
 * naive subtraction goes negative and, if you take its absolute value, starts
 * growing again — a child that rounds back off as you pad it further.
 *
 * `hairline` is the part nobody gets right, and it is why this is a function
 * instead of a comment. `border-radius` is measured on the element's OUTER
 * edge, so a 1px border sits between the two curves and counts toward the
 * offset exactly as padding does. The toolbar had `border: 1px` + `padding: 4px`
 * around 12px children under a 16px pill and read as concentric in the source —
 * it was off by one on screen for as long as it existed, because the true gap
 * was 5. Declaring the INSET and letting this subtract the border is what stops
 * that arithmetic being done by eye at each call site.
 *
 * It throws rather than returning a wrong-looking number, and that is
 * deliberate. These calls run when the stylesheet module is EVALUATED, so an
 * inset that does not land back on the radius ramp takes down every test that
 * imports the sheet — `npm test` names the container and the arithmetic. Not
 * `npm run build`: esbuild bundles this file without running it, so a bad nest
 * compiles perfectly and then throws the first time anything loads it.
 *
 * The ramp is 4/8/10/12/14/16/18/22/26 and a hairline is 1, so the mistake it
 * catches is nearly always one of two — an inset that forgot the border, or an
 * odd padding that lands the child between two steps of a scale the rest of

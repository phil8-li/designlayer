/**
 * How many places render this component — asked once, remembered, and shown
 * before a designer commits an edit that reaches all of them.
 *
 * This is the answer to the worst silent behaviour the editor had. Recolouring
 * a `Button` edits `button.tsx`, and if forty screens render that component,
 * forty screens change. The write was correct, instant, and completely quiet:
 * nothing counted the call sites, nothing warned, and the designer found out
 * when somebody else noticed. There was nowhere to put the warning either —
 * the write happened on a slider drag, and a modal over a slider is not a
 * warning, it is an obstruction.
 *
 * The Changes tab is what made it solvable. A row sits in a list the designer
 * reads BEFORE pressing the button that writes it, which is the one moment
 * where "this reaches 14 places" is information rather than interruption.
 *
 * WHY A CACHE, and why it is never invalidated. The question costs a walk of
 * the whole project, and the answer is asked once per row per repaint — a
 * number scrub would fire it dozens of times a second. It is also stable in the
 * way that matters: call sites change when somebody edits the project's source,
 * which is not something this editor does between two repaints of a panel. A
 * stale count here is off by the one call site a designer added in their own
 * editor a minute ago, and being one out is immaterial to a warning whose whole
 * job is to say "this is shared, look before you write".

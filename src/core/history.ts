/**
 * One undo timeline for everything the editor changes.
 *
 * The engine we vendor keeps an undo stack of its own, and nothing this editor
 * does ever reaches it: it is pushed only from the vendor's annotation, colour
 * and text tools, all of which are suppressed chrome here — this editor writes
 * through `core/writer` instead. So `store.canUndo()` was false in every
 * session and the toolbar's Undo button was permanently disabled. The stack is
 * also pop-only — `canvasUndo()` reverts an entry and discards it — so it could
 * not have answered Shift+Cmd+Z even if it had been reachable.
 *
 * The timeline therefore lives where the edits do. Every control writes through
 * the writer, which is the one path from a control to the page, so recording
 * the inverse there is what makes this cover the whole editor rather than the
 * surfaces someone remembered to wire up — including a section added next
 * month, which gets undo without knowing this file exists.

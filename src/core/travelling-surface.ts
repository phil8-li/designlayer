/**
 * The selected thing in a strip of things, as ONE object that moves.
 *
 * ## The pattern
 *
 * A tab strip and a segmented control state selection the same way: the chosen
 * item wears a filled surface. Painting that surface on the item itself makes
 * the selection two boxes taking turns — the old one vanishes, the new one
 * appears, and nothing crosses the gap for the eye to follow. A single node
 * that travels says the same thing as one object, which is what the control is
 * actually about.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * It was written twice before it was written once. The tab pill got a module
 * with a `ResizeObserver`; the segmented thumb got an inline copy in
 * `inspector/field.ts` with no observer and a different rung. Same idea, two
 * implementations, free to drift — which is the thing this codebase keeps
 * closing elsewhere and had just re-opened.
 *
 * The DURATIONS stay different and that is deliberate: a tab pill crosses a
 * label's width and a segment thumb crosses a whole segment, so the tab takes
 * `snap` and the segment `fast`. That is a parameter, not a reason for two
 * files. Everything else — the measurement, the refusal to publish one it does
 * not have, the first-placement jump, the re-measure on resize — is identical
 * and is here.
 *
 * ## What it refuses to do
 *
 * Publish a measurement of zero. `offsetWidth` is zero in JSDOM and in any
 * panel that has not painted, and a surface parked at the origin with no width
 * is worse than no surface at all. The `[data-de-<flag>]` attribute is set only
 * once a real measurement exists, and each stylesheet uses that flag to decide
 * between the travelling surface and the per-item background it replaces. So an
 * unmeasured strip keeps exactly the appearance it had before this existed.

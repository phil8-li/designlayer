/**
 * The chrome's tooltip: React Bits' `WarmTooltip`, ported to plain DOM.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT IS
 *
 * https://reactbits.dev/micro/warm-tooltip. One card shared by every control on
 * the page, with a state machine rather than a delay:
 *
 *   COLD    nothing has been shown recently. The pointer has to rest on a
 *           control for 400ms, and the card POPS in — 160ms, scaling up from
 *           0.94, un-blurring from 4px, rising 4px away from its control.
 *   WARM    a card is up, or one was up within the last 300ms. The wait is
 *           gone: the reader has declared they are reading tooltips.
 *   MOVE    a card is up and the pointer arrives somewhere else. The card does
 *           not close and reopen. It TRAVELS — one 320ms spring carrying its
 *           position and its width and height to the next control — while the
 *           old label slides out and the new one slides in across it.
 *   GRACE   the pointer leaves. Nothing happens for 80ms, because the 4px gap
 *           between two toolbar buttons is not the reader leaving the toolbar.
 *
 * The behaviour this replaces had the first two of those and neither of the
 * last two: it hid the card and showed a new one at the new place, which is the
 * flicker the warm window exists to prevent, moved one level up. The travel is
 * the whole point of the component — a strip of ten tools reads as one label
 * following the pointer rather than ten labels firing at it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: THE PORT'S BUDGET
 *
 * Upstream is a React component built on `motion/react`: a provider, a trigger
 * wrapper element per control, seven motion values and a `useTransform` graph
 * recomputed every frame. None of that could be adopted as written. The chrome
 * is plain DOM by policy (`core/dom.ts` — a second React tree in the app's
 * document fights the app's own reconciler), and the previous card cost exactly
 * zero animation frames, so a port that spends a frame budget to look nicer has
 * regressed the editor it is decorating.
 *
 * So the motion is split three ways by what each part actually needs, cheapest
 * mechanism first:
 *
 *   THE POP — a CSS transition. Opacity, transform and filter between two
 *   declared states, interpolated on the compositor with no script running at
 *   all. It also interrupts correctly for free: leaving 60ms into a 160ms pop
 *   resumes from wherever the value is, which upstream gets from Motion and a
 *   hand-rolled interpolation would get wrong.
 *
 *   THE LABEL SWAP — `Element.animate()`. Two short opacity/transform/filter
 *   animations, fire-and-forget, composited, no per-frame callback and no
 *   forced reflow to start them.
 *
 *   THE TRAVEL — a `requestAnimationFrame` spring, and the only per-frame work
 *   in the file. It has to be: the card's WIDTH and HEIGHT are springing, an
 *   interruption has to carry velocity, and a keyframed approximation of either
 *   is worse than the real thing. It runs only while a card is moving between
 *   two controls, stops itself the frame it settles, and writes three
 *   properties on one fixed-position element whose children are absolutely
 *   positioned — so nothing outside the card is laid out.
 *
 * The three listeners that cost something when NOTHING is happening — scroll,
 * resize and `visibilitychange` — are attached when a card opens and removed
 * when it closes. The previous implementation held a document-wide capturing
 * scroll listener for the entire session, so the idle cost of the chrome is
 * lower after this change than before it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PLACEMENT: VIEWPORT, NOT THE APP INSET
 *
 * `placeTip` below is the standard three-step — PREFER a side, FLIP to the
 * other when the preferred one overflows, SHIFT along the cross axis to stay
 * inside — as a pure function, so it can be checked against synthetic rects
 * without a browser. It is kept from the implementation this replaces and is
 * strictly more than upstream does: `WarmTooltip` clamps the cross axis and
 * never flips, which is fine for a demo page and not for a card hung off a
 * toolbar pinned 12px from the bottom of the window.
 *
 * `annotations/canvas.ts` clamps its composer against `--de-left`/`--de-right`
 * rather than the window, because a composer that slides under the inspector
 * has a Save button nobody can press. This does the opposite and the difference
 * is stacking: the composer is painted below the panels, the tooltip is painted
 * above everything (`css/tooltip.ts` pins it over the shortcuts sheet). A tip
 * overlapping a panel is a tip sitting on top of a panel, which is what a
 * tooltip is for. The viewport is the only edge it has.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ACCESSIBILITY: THE CARD IS DECORATION, AND IS MARKED AS SUCH
 *
 * `aria-hidden="true"` on the card; the control keeps its own `aria-label`.
 * Upstream does the opposite — `role="tooltip"` plus an `aria-describedby`
 * pointed at it — and that is the one part of the component this port
 * deliberately did not take, for three reasons that are all about what the call
 * sites already say. Every tipped control in this chrome is named with the same
 * words as its tip: `shell/toolbar.ts` emits `data-de-tip` and `aria-label`
 * from one helper, and `test/annotation-cases.mjs` asserts the two attributes
 * are EQUAL on the row actions. A description would therefore read the label
 * back a second time ("Undo, button, Undo"). Second, one shared card means one
 * id pointed at by whichever control is hovered, re-pointed on every pointer
 * move — a moving target in the accessibility tree for a surface that exists
 * only for a pointer, and upstream only gets away with it because its card
 * unmounts between runs. Third, the three implementations this lineage replaced
 * were pseudo-elements, which are not in the accessibility tree at all, so
 * hiding the card keeps the announced experience byte-for-byte what it is.
 *
 * The one thing that is genuinely not announced either way is the toolbar's
 * shortcut suffix — the tip says "Undo · ⌘Z" and the label says "Undo". That is
 * unchanged, and the fix for it is a real `aria-keyshortcuts` on the control,
 * not a description on a hover card.

 * text is 300ms of visibly soft glyphs. The ratio matters, not the rounding.
 *
 * ζ = 0.9 overshoots by `e^(-πζ/√(1-ζ²))`, about 0.15% — a pixel on a long

/**
 * Keeping a panel where the reader left it across a rebuild.
 *
 * Several surfaces in this chrome are redrawn wholesale on every write: the
 * inspector's Design tab empties its host and re-runs eleven sections after any
 * committed property, the outbox rebuilds both of its lists whenever a note or
 * an edit lands. That is a deliberate trade — one render path, no diffing — and
 * it costs exactly two things. Focus is the first, and
 * `panels/inspector/index.ts` has restored that since the beginning. Scroll
 * position is the second, and it was not restored at all.
 *
 * ## Why an emptied panel loses its scroll, and why that is not obvious
 *
 * Removing the children does not itself move the scroll position; the browser
 * does, the next time anything forces layout while the container is empty. A
 * scroller whose content is gone has a maximum scroll offset of zero, so the
 * engine clamps `scrollTop` to zero, and refilling it a microsecond later does
 * not undo the clamp — the number is already lost. Something always forces that
 * layout mid-rebuild: the inspector's sections read computed geometry off the
 * selected element while they build their rows, which is a flush.
 *
 * Measured against a live app before the fix: scroll the Design tab down to
 * Typography (666px), change the weight, and the panel is back at the top with
 * the control you just used off screen. Tweaking one property is the single
 * most repeated gesture in the editor, so this fired constantly.
 *
 * ## Two mechanisms, and the pin is the one that matters
 *
 * `hold()` pins the CONTENT's height before the caller empties it, so the
 * scroller never sees a container it has to clamp and the position is never
 * lost in the first place. Nothing to restore means no scroll event, which
 * matters more than it sounds: `inspector/token-picker.ts` closes an open
 * popover on any capture-phase scroll, so a chrome that fixed this by scrolling
 * back would dismiss the picker every time the panel repainted under it.
 *
 * `release()` then drops the pin and writes the remembered offset back, which
 * is a no-op whenever the pin did its job. It is kept as the backstop for the
 * cases the pin cannot cover — a host that measured zero because its panel was
 * hidden, and JSDOM, which has no layout and so has no height to pin — and it
 * costs one assignment that the engine skips when the value already matches.
 *
 * Both halves clamp themselves: a rebuild that produces a SHORTER panel than
 * the one before it settles at the new bottom rather than at a remembered
 * offset that no longer exists, because that is what assigning a too-large
 * `scrollTop` does.

 * grandchildren of theirs, sharing a wrapper with each other.
 *
 * The immediate parent is the fallback, and it is the right one twice over.
 * Every pane in this chrome wraps its body directly, so it is the correct
 * answer for two of the three call sites without any lookup at all — and it is
 * the answer JSDOM gets, where a suite that never injects the stylesheet would
 * otherwise find no scroller anywhere and quietly assert nothing.

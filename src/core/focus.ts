/**
 * Focus the editor moves itself, without lighting a keyboard ring for a mouse.
 *
 * The editor forces focus constantly. `shell.ts` refocuses the control under
 * every pointerdown on our chrome, because the vendor's document guard eats the
 * native default action; menus focus their first row when they open; closing a
 * popover puts focus back on the trigger that opened it. All of that is
 * *script* focus, and script focus is where `:focus-visible` stops being free.
 *
 * An engine cannot see what a script focus was for, so Chrome keeps the ring:
 * measured in Chrome 153, `button.focus()` during a plain mouse click makes the
 * button match `:focus-visible`, and every toolbar button the user clicked wore
 * the 2px accent ring that is supposed to mean "you are navigating by
 * keyboard". The stylesheets were never at fault — every ring in `core/css` is
 * already keyed on `:focus-visible` rather than `:focus`.
 *
 * So the modality is tracked here, in one place, and spent twice. `focusVisible`
 * on the focus call is the precise half — the one channel for telling an engine
 * what a script focus was for, and it is honoured exactly: measured in the same
 * build, `false` suppresses the ring and `true` keeps it. One stylesheet rule
 * keyed on the same modality is the blunt half, and it is not redundant: it
 * covers the control that is ALREADY focused, where there is no focus change
 * for an option to ride on, and the engines that do not implement the option.
 *
 * The rule is live, which makes this a statement about the gesture rather than
 * about the instant focus moved: reach for the mouse and the ring goes, press a
 * key and it returns on whatever still holds focus.

 * The focus option above cannot cover two cases on its own, and both are ones a
 * user meets.
 *
 * The first is a control that is ALREADY focused. Click the button you just
 * tabbed to and `focus()` is a no-op — no focus change, so nothing reads the
 * option, so the ring the keyboard earned stays on through a gesture that is no
 * longer the keyboard's. A page without our guard never shows this, because
 * there the click's own default action does the update this rule now does.
 *
 * The second is an engine that does not implement `focusVisible` at all (Safari,
 * as of writing), where the option is ignored in silence.
 *
 * `!important` because it has to beat sixty per-component rules it knows
 * nothing about, and `outline` only: the two-tone marker rings pair their
 * outline with a `box-shadow` halo, and blanking `box-shadow` here would take
 * the marker's own drop shadow with it, which is not focus state at all. In
 * Chrome and Firefox the option has already stopped those halos one step
 * earlier, by keeping the element from matching `:focus-visible`.

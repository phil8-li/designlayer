/**
 * The editor's one keyboard listener, and the panel that documents it.
 *
 * Everything about WHICH key means what lives in `core/keymap.ts`; everything
 * about what a command DOES lives in the lane that owns the surface. This file
 * is the wire between them, and it is deliberately the only wire — before it
 * there were two listeners answering three chords between them, each with its
 * own copy of the guards, which is a shape that does not survive a Figma-sized
 * keymap.
 *
 * ## The one rule that is not Figma's
 *
 * Figma owns the whole window. This editor is a guest on someone else's page,
 * and the page has its own keyboard: a prototype may well bind `c`, or `/`, or
 * the arrows. So bare-letter shortcuts are a loan, and the terms are that the
 * editor gives them back the moment it stands down to the floating disc.
 *
 * That gate is `shortcutFor` in the keymap, not a `chromeHidden` check here,
 * because it has to hold for every row including ones added later — a rule
 * enforced at the dispatch site is a rule the next contributor has to remember.
 * The single exception is ⌘., which is how the editor comes back; a platform
 * accelerator with a period on it is not a key a prototype reasonably claims.
 *
 * ## Capture, and why the swallow is conditional
 *
 * Registered at capture on `window` for the same reason the canvas lane is: the
 * vendor overlay guards the document and an app may stop the event on its way
 * up. But the event is only cancelled once a command has actually RUN —
 * `runCommand` reports whether anything was registered under the name. A chord
 * whose lane is not mounted has to fall through to the page rather than being
 * eaten by an editor that cannot act on it.
 *
 * ## The one other listener, and why it is not a chord
 *
 * Escape collapses the editor, and it is the LAST thing Escape means: it closes
 * an overlay first, clears the selection second, and only stands the editor
 * down on a press nothing else took. That cannot be a row dispatched from the
 * table — the table is matched at capture, which is the earliest anything sees
 * a key, and this step is defined by being the latest. So it has a listener of
 * its own on the bubble phase at the bottom of `installShortcuts`. The rule it
 * asks is still the keymap's (`isCollapseFallback`); only the timing differs.

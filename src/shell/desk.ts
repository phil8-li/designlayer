/**
 * DesignLayer.app, from the chrome's side.
 *
 * The Mac app (desktop/mac) is one window of tabs, each an iframe of an editor
 * like this one, served by a "desk" on another loopback port. The same editor
 * can be open there or in a browser tab, and the toolbar offers the move in
 * one direction: out of a browser tab and into the app. Inside the app there
 * is nowhere better to send it, so the control is not drawn there at all.
 *
 * Moving is a hand-off rather than a copy. The vendor's socket takes one
 * client, so the app's frame connecting is what disconnects this tab — nothing
 * here has to close it, and nothing could: a script may only close windows a
 * script opened.

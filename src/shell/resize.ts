/**
 * Draggable panel seams.
 *
 * Both side panels can be resized by their inner edge, with the keyboard, and
 * by a double-click that puts them back where they started. None of that is
 * written here: the mechanism is `motion-panels`, and specifically its
 * framework-agnostic core rather than its React adapter, because this overlay
 * is plain DOM on purpose (`core/dom.ts` has the reason — a second React tree
 * in the app's document would fight the app's own reconciler).
 *
 * The core is a pure state machine. It owns the drag session, the bounds, the
 * rubber band at the limits, the keyboard map, the fold animation, and the
 * `role="separator"` ARIA values — and it writes no styles at all. What it
 * publishes is a `MotionValue` per panel, and every pixel that reaches the
 * screen is written below, by us, out of that value. So the panels keep their
 * own stylesheet and the library supplies only the number, which is what makes
 * "add resizing" a change with no visual design in it.
 *
 * ## Two widths, not one
 *
 * Each panel has a DESIRED width — what the user dragged it to, and what gets
 * persisted — and an APPLIED width, which is the desired one after the window
 * has had its say. They are separate because the alternative loses information:
 * squeeze a 420px inspector down to 260 to fit a narrow window, write that back
 * as the desired width, and widening the window again leaves it at 260 with
 * nothing to restore from. Keeping the two apart is what makes the layout
 * actually elastic — `layout()` below re-derives applied from desired on every
 * window resize, so a panel gives room up under pressure and takes it back when
 * the pressure goes.
 *
 * ## Where the app's inset comes from
 *
 * The app is inset by padding on `<html>` (`--de-left` / `--de-right`, written
 * by `shell.ts`), and `shell.ts` has a long-standing rule that the inset moves
 * in ONE step rather than animating, because transitioning it relayouts the
 * whole app on every frame. That rule survives here, narrowed rather than
 * broken: during a DRAG the inset follows the live value, because a resize the
 * app does not follow is not a resize — you would be dragging a panel over a
 * page that reflows once you let go. Every other time the width moves under its
 * own animation (a fold settling, a window resize) the inset jumps straight to
 * the destination and the panel slides over ground the app has already given
 * up, which is exactly what the hide/show transition already does.

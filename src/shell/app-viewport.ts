/**
 * THE CANVAS IS THE APP'S VIEWPORT.
 *
 * `shell.ts` insets the app with padding on a border-box `<html>`, and for an
 * app laid out in percentages that is the whole story: the containing block
 * narrows, the app reflows, both panels behave the same way.
 *
 * An app laid out in VIEWPORT UNITS never hears about it. `100vw` is the
 * window, and the window does not change when a panel opens — so a shell with
 * `width: 100vw` stayed 1440px wide inside a 940px containing block and simply
 * overflowed. The asymmetry that gets reported is the giveaway: padding on the
 * LEFT moves the app's origin, so the left panel looks like it works, while
 * padding on the right has nothing to push against and the app runs on
 * underneath the inspector. Measured exactly that way on a real prototype —
 * `.app-shell { width: calc(100vw - …) }`, right edge at 1680px on a 1440px
 * window with the inspector open.
 *
 * MEDIA QUERIES are the same claim in the other direction, and leaving them out
 * makes "responsive" a half-truth. An app whose canvas is 940px wide should be
 * wearing its 940px layout; asking the window means it wears the 1440px one,
 * squeezed — which is not a width the designer can ever ship. So a width
 * feature is shifted by the inset: `(max-width: 1024px)` matches when the
 * CANVAS is under 1024, which is when the window is under 1024 plus whatever
 * the panels are holding.
 *
 * ## What this does not reach
 *
 * Inline `style` attributes, stylesheets from another origin (their rules are
 * unreadable by definition), rules a library inserts straight into the CSSOM
 * after the last scan, `vmin`/`vmax` (they mix an axis this does not move),
 * and `matchMedia` in the app's own JavaScript, which reports the window and
 * would need its listeners re-fired to say anything else. Each of those is a
 * layout the editor leaves as the window drew it, which is what it did for
 * everything before this file existed.
 *
 * ## Why the CSSOM rather than the source
 *
 * Nothing here touches a file. The rewrite is a live edit of the rules the
 * browser already parsed, undone in full by `destroy()`, and no lane in this
 * editor reads the app's CSSOM — so a rewritten value cannot travel back into
 * anyone's stylesheet on a source write.

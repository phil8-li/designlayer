/**
 * Floating bottom toolbar: one row of icons, read left to right.
 *
 * Every control in it is a glyph with a hover tip now, including the two that
 * used to carry words. The mode switch was the last holdout and the argument
 * for its label was a good one — no 16px drawing says "the editor is not
 * intercepting your clicks" — but the bar it was written for had three
 * controls in it. At nine, one wide pill among eight squares is not emphasis,
 * it is a ragged row: the squares no longer line up into clusters, and the
 * cluster is the thing that makes nine controls findable at all. The word did
 * not disappear, it moved into the tip and into the accessible name, which is
 * where every other control in this strip has always kept its.
 *
 * It used to carry a zoom stepper, a measurement reminder and an overflow menu
 * inventorying every Figma tool this editor does not have. All three answered
 * questions nobody asked at the bottom of the screen — the zoom scaled a
 * transformed ancestor the product's own `layoutId` morphs cannot survive, the
 * measure button was a label for a modifier that works whether or not you press
 * it, and the inventory was a changelog wearing a menu. What is left is the set
 * of things a click here actually does.
 *
 * Two more went the same way, and for the same reason.
 *
 *  - The Hand tool. It suppressed selection so the page could be scrolled, but
 *    the wheel and the trackpad scroll the live page in EVERY mode, so all it
 *    added was a state in which clicking did nothing — the exact thing the mode
 *    switch below now says in a word.
 *  - The Move tool, as a separate button. With Hand gone it was a one-member
 *    radio group: a control whose pressed state could never change. The arrow it
 *    drew was the useful part, so the arrow moved INTO the mode switch, where it
 *    finally means something, because there the pointer really does change hands.
 *
 * The two panel toggles STAY here, and this is the one place they live — a
 * disclosure with two homes is a disclosure with two answers. Each draws ONE
 * mark, and the mark is now the PANEL rather than what the panel holds: a
 * framed box with its left column inked, and the same box mirrored. Naming the
 * contents (a layer stack, a slider rack) made two unrelated drawings that had
 * to be learned as a pair, and dated as soon as either panel grew a second tab.
 * Left and right are read rather than remembered.
 *
 * They are also the two controls in the bar that report ON without the accent
 * chip. The glyph fills, and that is all — see `quiet` on `panelToggle`.
 *
 * Every glyph in the strip is drawn at ONE size, `GLYPH`, and inks the same
 * share of its grid (see `inkViewBox` in `core/icons.ts`). Two glyphs at the
 * same nominal size still read a step apart when one of them fills more of its
 * box, so the size alone was never the whole of "consistent".
 *
 * "Copy notes and edits" has left this bar for the second time, and this time
 * without a square. It came back once because the panel that holds the same
 * Copy can be CLOSED, and handing the work over from the only place it was
 * drawn meant first reopening 260px you had shut on purpose. That argument
 * expired with the change below it: Notes and Inspect now raise the right panel
 * on the tab that answers them, so the list is up by the time there is anything
 * in it worth copying. What is left is the chord — `notes.copy` runs
 * `copyBrief` directly, and a keydown is as much a user gesture as a click, so
 * the clipboard still opens for it.
 *
 * One thing LEFT this bar, and it was never a tool: the way back to the
 * chooser. It names the app the whole editor is pointed at, and that is a
 * statement about what you are looking at rather than a thing you do to this
 * page — while everything else in this strip is a verb about the current
 * selection. A control answering "which app is this?" belongs above the panel
 * that lists what is IN that app, not among the verbs, so it now lives at the
 * top of the left panel, where the name it shows reads as the heading for the
 * tree underneath it instead of as the one word in a row of glyphs.
 *
 * The remaining tool state is still mirrored into the vendor engine so its
 * selection mode stays in sync with ours — two sources of truth for "what does a
 * click do" is the fastest way to make a direct-manipulation tool feel broken.
 *
 * Read left to right the row is: what a click does (the pointer, and notes) —
 * what to do with what you did (step back, step forward) — and what the editor
 * is showing you (how the chrome is painted, the left panel, the right panel,
 * and then the whole editor away).
 *
 * The two mode controls also REACH the right panel, which is the one place this
 * bar's clusters touch. Inspect raises Design, Notes raises Changes; each mode
 * has exactly one tab that is the rest of it, and the pairing is enforced in
 * `setMode` (`core/context.ts`) rather than here, so the keymap cannot arrive
 * at a different panel than the buttons do.
 *
 * The pill also MOVES. It is a floating surface over someone else's product,
 * and the product does not know it is coming: parked at the bottom centre it
 * covers a tab bar on one app and a cookie banner on the next, and the only
 * remedy was to hide the whole editor. It is draggable by its ground now, the
 * way Agentation's is, and it remembers where it was put. The disc remembers
 * its own corner separately — `shell/launcher.ts` owns the gesture both use,
 * and nothing else about either of them.

 * than a different value on the one already mounted.
 *
 * ## Both drawings are mounted, and the flip is a crossfade
 *
 * This used to be `replaceChildren`, and a replacement cannot be animated: the
 * new node has no previous state, so it paints at its final appearance and the
 * change is a cut. `core/swap-mark.ts` holds the general form of the fix —
 * stack the two glyphs in one sized box and crossfade — and this takes the
 * TOGGLE variant of it, which keeps `currentColor` instead of going green,
 * because the accent surface under a pressed tool has already said which state
 * it is in and a second, greener claim would contradict it.
 *
 * ## Why the guard outlived the rewrite
 *
 * `syncPressed` runs on selection, on history and on every queue change, and
 * the weight is unchanged in nearly all of them. Under the old build an
 * unconditional call tore the node out from under the pointer — dropping hover
 * until it moved — and restarted the stroke transition in `css/icons.ts`, so a
 * glyph flickered while a selection was being dragged around. Under this one a
 * redundant call would only be a redundant `classList.toggle`, but the guard
 * stays: it is also what keeps a repaint that changed nothing from re-running
 * the crossfade.
 *
 * The pair is built on first use and cached against the element, so it cannot
 * outlive the button it belongs to; a control whose glyph NAME changes gets a
 * fresh pair rather than a stale one.

   * ITS OWN POSITION, and only its own. The drag holds the box it last
   * resolved, which outlives every collapse and expand of the session because
   * the element and the gesture both do — so a bar that was moved is still
   * moved when the editor comes back. The disc keeps a separate one. They were
   * briefly a single shared position, which is what a collapse that MORPHED
   * one surface into the other needed; the collapse is a fade now, nothing
   * travels, and two surfaces you can park independently is the better trade.
   *
   * THE GROUND ONLY. A press that lands on a control belongs to that control,
   * so `grabbable` declines it and the drag is never armed — which is also why
   * a drag can never fire the control it ends over. The browser dispatches a
   * click to the nearest common ancestor of the mousedown and the mouseup
   * targets, and a gesture that began on the ground has a ground element on one
   * side of that pair, so the common ancestor is always the bar itself and
   * never a button inside it. Worth knowing because the obvious belt — swallow
   * the click in a capture listener — does NOT work in this chrome: the
   * shell's `restoreChromeFocus` guard replaces `stopPropagation` and
   * `preventDefault` with no-ops for every event aimed at our own surfaces, so
   * a handler here cannot cancel anything. See `shell/shell.ts`.
   *
   * `--de-bar-left` / `--de-bar-right`, not the app's own pair. Those two hold
   * their value while the chrome is hidden; the app's collapse to zero. A bar
   * clamped against zero the moment it is hidden would slide out from under
   * the panels while it faded, which is the exact jump those variables were
   * introduced to prevent, now applied to a bar that has been dragged.
   *
   * `panelInset` as the margin, because that is the inset the pill rests at.

   *
   * The existing subscriptions cover the QUEUES — the vendor store, the Angular
   * queue, the removal queue — which is what the old commit button cared about.
   * The count is a different list: a pinned note or a stranded write changes it
   * without touching any queue, and a commit clearing `queued` changes it
   * without touching the store. Both of those left the number stale for as long
   * as the bar sat there, which on a collapsed panel is the whole session.

/**
 * The editor's floating chrome: where it is parked, the gesture that moves it,
 * and the round button the whole thing collapses into.
 *
 * Two things in one file, and the join is the gesture. The toolbar pill and
 * this disc are separate objects that are moved the same way, so the drag
 * belongs to neither of them: `installDrag` is the whole of it, and
 * `shell/toolbar.ts` imports it and adds nothing but its own box, its own
 * bounds and its own idea of what counts as ground.
 *
 * They each remember where they were put, separately. See the note below.
 *
 * The disc's treatment is Agentation's (agentation.com), because it is the
 * pattern a designer arriving at this editor has most likely already used: a
 * 44px dark disc pinned 20px off the corner, slack before a press becomes a
 * drag, the press that turns into a drag never counting as a click, and the
 * position remembered for next time. The numbers below are that behaviour, not
 * invented ones.
 *
 * Three places this improves on it rather than copying it. It listens for
 * POINTER events with capture instead of mouse events on `document`, so a pen
 * or a touch drags it too and the gesture cannot be lost to a window that takes
 * focus mid-drag; it ignores every contact after the first, because a second
 * finger landing on a surface already being dragged is the other hand steadying
 * a tablet and not a second gesture; and the move is applied inside an
 * animation frame rather than once per event, so a fast drag costs one layout
 * per frame instead of one per pointermove.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT improve on is the edge. The bound used to
 * give: a rubber band followed the hand past it and handed the overhang back on
 * release. It is a hard clamp now, which is Agentation's behaviour and the
 * right one for these two surfaces — the band is borrowed from scrolling, where
 * what the overhang reveals is empty space the user owns. These two hang over
 * somebody else's product, so the overhang is live app pixels covered by chrome
 * that is not allowed to be there, and "momentarily wrong" is a flash of
 * hidden UI rather than a piece of physics.

// ───────────────────────────── two surfaces, two positions ────

/*
 * Each surface remembers where IT was put. There is no shared position.
 *
 * There was one, and it was the wrong model. The bar and the disc were treated
 * as one object with two appearances, so dragging either moved both and the bar
 * came back wherever the disc had been parked. That follows from a collapse
 * that MORPHS one into the other — which this no longer does. The editor stands
 * down by fading the bar out where it is, sliding the panels off their own
 * edges, and showing the disc in the corner; nothing travels, so nothing has to
 * agree about where it travelled to.
 *
 * With them uncoupled, "remember the position" means the obvious thing and each
 * surface answers it for itself: the drag holds the box it last resolved, which
 * outlives every collapse and expand of the session because the element and its
 * gesture both do. `fallback` is only the seed for a surface that has a
 * position from somewhere else before it has one of its own — the disc's saved
 * corner, and nothing else uses it.
 *
 * A dragged bar is deliberately NOT written to storage. It survives every
 * collapse, which is what was asked for; it does not survive a reload, because
 * a 600px pill that reappears in the middle of a freshly loaded page reads as a
 * layout that has broken rather than as a preference being honoured, and there
 * is nothing on screen at that moment to explain it. The disc does persist: it
 * is 44px, it rests in a corner by design, and that memory is Agentation's

 * leaves a drop INTO the field working, which is the direction that cannot lose

   * chrome stands BETWEEN the top of a document and its content. This chrome is
   * appended to `<body>`, so it is last in the order: there is nothing behind
   * it to skip to.
   *
   * The real gap is the mirror image. A keyboard user who has arrived in the
   * editor — by ⇧⌘1, or by tabbing to the end of the app — faces roughly forty
   * stops across a toolbar, two panels and whatever the inspector is showing,
   * with no way back to the page short of tabbing through all of them. The
   * editor already owns the right verb for that: collapse to the disc, and the
   * page has its keyboard back.
   *
   * So this is ONE stop, first in the chrome's order, doing exactly that. A
   * real `<button>` rather than an anchor, because it performs an action rather
   * than going to a fragment.
   *
   * VISUALLY HIDDEN UNTIL FOCUSED, which is the whole convention: a pointer
   * user has the launcher disc and the ⌘. accelerator and does not need a
   * forty-first control in the bar, while a keyboard user meets this one before
   * any of the forty. `.de-escape` in `css/base.ts` is the clipped-until-
   * focused half.
   *
   * It does NOT move focus itself. Collapsing takes the chrome to
   * `visibility: hidden`, so the browser drops focus to `<body>` of its own
   * accord and the next Tab resumes at the top of the page — which is where
   * someone leaving the editor is trying to get to. Forcing focus onto a

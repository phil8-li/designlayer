/**
 * DS Lint: run the audit, read what it found, fix or dismiss it.
 *
 * The verb is **Audit**. One word, it is what designers already call this, and
 * it promises a report rather than a boolean — which matters here because the
 * honest answer is almost never "compliant" or "not", it is a list with some
 * things on it that can be fixed automatically and some that cannot.
 *
 * It was a standalone panel in the left rail with a header bar of its own, and
 * it is now a `section()` on the right panel's Design system tab, sitting under
 * Libraries. A panel wearing its own header inside a tab of sections is a
 * surface that looks like it was pasted in, and it made a reader learn two
 * headers for one idea; the section is what Fill, Typography and Handover all
 * are, so this is one thing to learn instead.
 *
 * ## The section is ONE control that grows, and one icon that explains itself
 *
 * Two things a designer never asked to decide used to be on screen before they
 * had pressed anything: WHICH checker runs, as a row of chips, and what to do
 * with a report that did not exist yet, as a footer of two buttons.
 *
 * Neither is a decision. The server already routes: `POST /lint/run` with no
 * `tools` key runs exactly the checkers that apply to this project, so the
 * chips were a list of an answer nobody had to give. They are now an INFO ICON
 * in the section header — hover it and it names, in one sentence, what is
 * running and what is not. See `checkerLine`.
 *
 * And Audit, Fix all and Hide markers are one BUTTON GROUP with two shapes.
 * Before a run it is a single Audit button, because "fix all of nothing" and
 * "hide markers that are not painted" are two controls about a list that does
 * not exist. The moment a run lands findings, the same group grows the other
 * two. That is also why Audit is no longer in the section header's actions
 * slot: a group whose first member lives in the header and whose other two live
 * in the body is not a group, it is three controls that happen to be related.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS THIS PANEL IS CAREFUL ABOUT, each of which is a way the same
 * screen can look fine while lying:
 *
 *  1. **A checker that will not run is still named, never silently dropped.** A
 *     tool that is installed but inapplicable — or configured but not
 *     resolvable — contributes nothing, and a surface that simply omits it
 *     reads as "everything was checked". The info icon's sentence names it on
 *     the "Not running" side, and when NOTHING can run the empty state spends
 *     the space the findings would have taken on each checker's own reason. A
 *     green audit that skipped a checker silently is the single most expensive
 *     thing this panel could do; moving that fact from three chips into one
 *     hover makes it quieter, and it must not make it absent.
 *
 *  2. **The summary counts this page as well as the project.** Most findings
 *     are in files the current route never renders, so the total and the number
 *     of badges on the canvas are routinely different numbers. A panel claiming
 *     twenty while the canvas paints twelve looks broken, and a designer only
 *     has to check it against the screen once to stop believing the rest of it.
 *     Both numbers come from `lintSummary`, whose on-page figure is the count of
 *     findings that resolved to a live element — the same resolution the marker
 *     layer paints from, not a second walk of the document.
 *
 *  3. **A subset can be chosen.** Per-row Fix is not the same feature as "let
 *     the user choose which ones to fix": the second one is about deciding
 *     across a list, and a list of forty rows cannot be triaged one button at a
 *     time. So every row carries a checkbox and the group's Fix button changes
 *     from "Fix all (12)" to "Fix 3" the moment anything is checked.
 *
 *  4. **An unfixable finding says why.** `fix: null` means the checker named no
 *     confident replacement — usually because it offered three near-matches, and
 *     picking one for the user is how a linter silently changes a colour nobody
 *     chose. The row states that in words instead of showing a button that does
 *     nothing, and points at the inspector, where the user picks the token
 *     themselves.
 *
 * ## What lives where
 *
 * Nothing about the canvas is decided here. The panel writes `markersShown` in
 * the store and the marker layer reads it; the two layers' mutual exclusion is
 * the marker layer's business, driven by that one boolean. Row and badge light
 * each other up through `designlayer:lint-hover` and its mirror, the same
 * window-event seam the annotation layer uses, for the same reason: neither
 * surface should have to import the other to exist.

 * Why a finding has no Fix button — the row's tooltip, not its body.
 *
 * The server only produces a `fix` when the checker named one replacement
 * outright. Everything else — a message listing three nearest candidates, a
 * hardcoded colour with no token anywhere near it — arrives as `null`, and the
 * reason is always the same one: there is no answer this editor is entitled to
 * pick on the user's behalf.
 *
 * It used to be a two-line paragraph printed on every unfixable row, which made
 * it the largest thing on this surface: the same forty words, forty times, in a
 * list whose whole job is to be skimmed. The row now says it the two ways a
 * skimming reader actually reads — no Fix button, and a four-word `hintFor`
 * naming the choice that is left — and the sentence is what hovering explains.
 * Identical prose repeated down a list is not emphasis; it is the thing the
 * reader learns to skip, and it takes the rows either side of it with it.
 *
 * It opens with the row's own four words rather than a second spelling of them.
 * This said "No safe automatic fix" while the row said "No automatic fix", and
 * a hover whose job is to expand the row instead restated it differently — two
 * names for one state, which reads as two states. `safe` was also doing no work
 * in a four-word hint: every fix this panel offers is one the checker named
 * outright, so there is no unsafe fix being withheld for the word to contrast
 * with. The full reason it might be is the sentence that follows.

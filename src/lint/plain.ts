/**
 * A finding, said in as few words as a designer can act on.
 *
 * A checker writes for the person who will edit the file. It names the literal,
 * the rule, the near misses, the file the tokens are declared in, and the two
 * or three things you could do instead — one paragraph, and every clause of it
 * earns its place in a terminal. Stacked forty times down a 260px rail it stops
 * being a report and becomes a wall, and the reader's question is not "what did
 * the linter say", it is **which colour, and what do I press**.
 *
 * So the row is built from three short pieces instead of one long sentence, and
 * this module is where a paragraph becomes those pieces:
 *
 *   - **the literal** — `rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.16)`, with the actual colour beside
 *     it. A designer recognises a swatch before they finish reading a word, and
 *     the literal is the one part of the message that is not prose.
 *   - **the replacement** — `→ var(--ds-sys-color-primary)`, when the server
 *     was confident enough to offer a Fix. An arrow between two swatches says
 *     the whole of what that Fix will do; a sentence saying the same thing is
 *     the sentence nobody reads twice.
 *   - **the hint** — three or four words for the case where there is no Fix,
 *     because THAT is the only row where the reader has a decision to make.
 *
 * Nothing is thrown away. The checker's paragraph is still on the row, in
 * `title` and in the accessible name, which is where a sentence belongs once
 * the glanceable version exists — see `panel.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why the plain names are a table and not a transform
 *
 * `no-raw-colors` → "Hardcoded colors" cannot be derived. Dropping `no-` and
 * unhyphenating gets there for that one rule and produces "Declaration property
 * value no unknown" for the next, which is worse than the id it replaced: an id
 * is at least recognisably an id, and a mangled phrase reads like English that
 * has gone wrong. So the rules this editor's own recommended checkers emit are
 * named by hand, everything else keeps its id verbatim, and the id is in
 * `title` either way. A table that covers eight rules honestly beats a
 * transform that covers all of them badly.

/**
 * The audit in the browser: what the checkers found, which findings are
 * dismissed, which layer owns the canvas, and — the part that is not
 * bookkeeping — WHICH ELEMENT each finding is about.
 *
 * A finding, as the server reports it, is a file and a line. A marker needs an
 * element, the panel's "on this page" figure needs a count of elements, and the
 * inspector needs to answer "does the thing I have selected have a finding on
 * it?" on every render. Those are three readings of ONE question, and this
 * module exists so that they are three readings of one ANSWER: the resolution
 * runs once per audit, into an index, and the marker layer, the summary and the
 * inspector all read it. Two surfaces resolving the same selectors separately
 * is how a panel comes to claim twenty markers while the canvas paints twelve,
 * which is the specific way this feature looks broken while every part of it is
 * working.
 *
 * ## The resolution seam, and why it is a hook rather than an import
 *
 * The marker layer owns how a CSS selector becomes elements — it has to, that
 * is the thing it draws. But the count has to agree with it, so one of the two
 * has to defer. It is arranged so that either direction works and neither can
 * produce a second answer:
 *
 *   - `resolveLintSelector` here is a complete implementation of the rules the
 *     marker contract states (state pseudo-classes stripped, framework scoping
 *     attributes stripped, unparseable parts skipped rather than thrown), so a
 *     marker layer can simply paint `lintResolution()` and nothing needs
 *     registering at all.
 *   - `setLintResolver` lets the marker layer install its own instead, and then
 *     the index — and therefore the count, and therefore `findingsFor` — is
 *     built from the marker layer's answer rather than from a second opinion.
 *
 * Either way there is exactly one resolution per run. What is NOT offered is a
 * way for the marker layer to report a count back after painting: a number
 * arriving after the panel has already drawn its summary is a number that is
 * one paint stale, and the panel would flicker between two totals.
 *
 * ## Loading follows `libraries/store.ts`
 *
 * One shared in-flight promise, a warning and an empty answer when the tool
 * list cannot be loaded, and a failure that is never cached so a dev server
 * that was still starting can be asked again. Mutations are the opposite and
 * REJECT: every one of them is a button somebody just pressed and the panel has
 * to be able to say what happened. Subscribers are notified synchronously
 * inside the same task as the write, because the frame a user looks hardest at
 * is the one straight after they pressed something.

/**
 * Audit findings, painted onto the page they are about.
 *
 * A finding is a file and a line. A marker is a thing on screen. The whole of
 * this module is the distance between those two sentences, and it is longer
 * than it looks: the linter read a stylesheet, the browser rendered elements,
 * and the only rope between them is the SELECTOR of the rule the finding sits
 * in. Everything below is either spanning that gap or refusing to span it
 * dishonestly.
 *
 * Three refusals are worth naming up front, because each one is a case where
 * painting something would have been easy and wrong:
 *
 *   - A selector that matches nothing is NOT an error. It is a finding in a
 *     stylesheet whose rule this route does not render, which is the ordinary
 *     case: an audit covers the project and a page shows one screen of it. It
 *     gets no marker, and it is the reason the panel's summary has to say how
 *     many findings are on THIS page — a panel claiming twenty while the canvas
 *     shows twelve reads as a broken marker layer rather than as a true
 *     statement about eight other routes. The count and the markers come from
 *     ONE resolution, registered into the store below, so the two cannot
 *     disagree even in principle.
 *
 *   - A selector the browser cannot parse takes itself down and nothing else.
 *     `querySelectorAll` throws a `SyntaxError` on anything it does not
 *     recognise, and one stylesheet using a syntax this browser has not shipped
 *     — or one plugin leaving a placeholder in a selector — would otherwise
 *     throw inside the resolve pass and lose every other finding's marker.
 *
 *   - A rule styling a STATE is marked on the element, not on the state. A
 *     `.btn--tonal:hover` finding is a real finding about a real button, and a
 *     marker that waited for the hover would be waiting for a gesture the user
 *     has no reason to make on the one element they were just told to look at.
 *     The pseudo is stripped and the base compound is marked. Same for
 *     `::after` — there is no node in the tree to mark, so the element that
 *     owns the pseudo-element is the only honest answer.
 *
 * The layer is inert (`pointer-events: none`) and only the badges take the
 * pointer, exactly as the annotation layer is, and for the same reason: this is
 * drawn over an app somebody is still trying to use.

/**
 * The seam between the Design system panel and this layer, and it is the SAME

 *

 * are mounted independently, neither owning the other, an import either way
 * making one unusable without the other — and it applies here without a word
 * changed. What differs is only the pair of names, because a lint row and a
 * note row are different objects and one shared event would light a note pin
 * from a finding's id.
 *
 *   `designlayer:lint-hover`         panel -> canvas  `{ id: string | null }`
 *     The pointer is on that finding's row, or has left every row. The badge
 *     carrying that finding takes `MARKER_ACTIVE`.
 *
 *   `designlayer:lint-marker-hover`  canvas -> panel  `{ id, ids }`
 *     The mirror. `id` is the finding the badge speaks for — the worst one on
 *     that element — and `ids` is every finding it covers, because one badge
 *     can stand for several rows and a panel that lit only one of them would be
 *     answering a question nobody asked. A listener written against the
 *     annotation seam's shape still works: `id` alone is the same contract.
 *
 * `null` is a value in the pair rather than a second event, for the reason the
 * annotation seam gives: a listener that only ever hears "now this one" is how
 * a highlight gets stuck on a row nobody is on.

 * dashboard of two hundred cards is one finding and two hundred elements, and
 * painting it faithfully is not a marker layer, it is a fog: the page is
 * covered, nothing is readable, and the one thing the user wanted — to see
 * WHERE the problem is — is the thing they can no longer do. Twenty is enough
 * to say "this is everywhere" and few enough to still see the page under it.
 *
 * The second cap is about cost rather than legibility. Every badge on screen
 * costs one `getBoundingClientRect` per frame, and the layer tracks
 * continuously because a sticky header or an opening accordion moves an element
 * without firing anything worth waking on. Two hundred reads a frame is a
 * budget; five thousand findings resolved to five thousand elements is not.

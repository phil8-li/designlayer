/**
 * `designlayer [appPort] [--config <path>] [--proxy-port N] [--ws-port N]`
 *
 * Every flag is consumed here. The vendored CLI parses `process.argv` at module
 * scope with commander and aborts on anything it does not declare, so argv is
 * rewritten into exactly its shape before it is imported — that reshape is what
 * makes first-party flags possible at all.
 *
 * With the start screen, this command runs in one of two roles. The SUPERVISOR
 * owns the chooser for the whole session and never boots an editor itself; each
 * app the user picks is a CHILD of it, started by re-running this same file with
 * `--no-start` and a port. The two are the same code because they are the same
 * command; `wantsStartScreen` is the whole fork.

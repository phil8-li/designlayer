/**
 * Renders the same interface state twice — as it was, and as it is — and builds
 * one page you can flip through to accept or reject each change.
 *
 * This is review tooling, not part of the editor: nothing under `src/`,
 * `server/` or `runtime/` knows it exists, and it only ever reads them. It is
 * the sibling of `tools/panel-harness.mjs`, which measures ONE revision against
 * a Figma frame; this one measures two revisions against each other.
 *
 * ## How "before" is obtained
 *
 * From git, not from a copy kept by hand. `--before=<rev>` names any revision
 * and the surface modules are read out of it with `git show`, written to a
 * scratch directory, and imported from there. A hand-maintained "before" is a
 * second source of truth that starts drifting the day it is written, and the
 * whole value of this page is that the left-hand column is really what shipped.
 *
 * Only the start screen can be done this way today, and the reason is the seam
 * rather than an omission: it is a self-contained document produced by a pure
 * function of no arguments, so an old revision of it renders with no editor, no
 * host app and no dev server. The editor chrome needs all three, which is what
 * `panel-harness.mjs` exists to stand up; extending this tool to cover it means
 * teaching it that harness's scene, not adding another `git show`.
 *
 *   node tools/before-after.mjs                    # against HEAD
 *   node tools/before-after.mjs --before=6681a93   # against a named revision
 *   node tools/before-after.mjs --open             # and open the page after
 *   node tools/before-after.mjs --no-shots         # page only, no browser
 *
 * Output lands in `.demos/` at the repo root, which is gitignored.

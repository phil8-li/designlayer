/**
 * The interfaces.dev cheat-sheet pass, rendered as a page you decide from.
 *
 * Third of the before/after tools, and it exists because the other two cannot
 * answer this question. `before-after.mjs` compares the start screen at two git
 * revisions; `chrome-demo.mjs` compares the editor's panels at two git
 * revisions. Both take their "before" out of git — and this pass was made on
 * top of a working tree with a hundred uncommitted files in it, so there is no
 * revision that is the before. A `git stash` would have taken the rest of that
 * work with it.
 *
 * So the before is a COPY of `src/`, `runtime/` and `tools/` taken before the
 * first edit of this pass, sitting in `.worktrees/cheatsheet-before/`. Same
 * mechanism as the git worktree in the sibling tool — a second tree, bundled
 * separately, touching the working tree not at all — with the snapshot standing
 * in for the revision.
 *
 *   node tools/cheatsheet-demo.mjs
 *   node tools/cheatsheet-demo.mjs --open
 *   node tools/cheatsheet-demo.mjs --only=toast-close,marquee
 *
 * Output lands in `.demos/cheatsheet/`, which is gitignored.

/**
 * A budget for the chrome's motion, so a polish pass cannot quietly cost speed.
 *
 * ## What this measures and why these numbers
 *
 * The editor is injected into somebody else's running app. Every byte of CSS is
 * parsed on their page, every animated property competes with their paint, and
 * the canvas overlay re-reads geometry on a rAF loop while anything is
 * selected. So the three things worth watching are SIZE, what gets animated,
 * and whether anything animates a property that forces layout.
 *
 * The ceilings below are not aspirations, they are the measured values at the
 * time this file was written plus a little headroom. The point is not to hit a
 * target; it is that adding motion without noticing is impossible.
 *
 * Run: `node tools/motion-budget.mjs [--json] [--update]`

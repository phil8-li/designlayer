/**
 * Two surfaces, rendered under worst-case content, on one page you read top to
 * bottom.
 *
 * The third of the review tools and the only one that is not a comparison.
 * `before-after.mjs` measures two revisions of the start screen against each
 * other; `chrome-demo.mjs` does the same for the editor's chrome. Both answer
 * "did this change land". Neither answers "does it survive a 200-character
 * package name", because both feed their surfaces the same tidy fixtures — a
 * project called `workspaces`, two dev servers, a path three folders deep — and
 * a surface built against one happy path looks finished right up until real
 * content arrives.
 *
 * So this one holds the revision still and varies the CONTENT: length, shape,
 * quantity, container width, zoom and every state each surface can reach. It
 * issues no verdict. It renders, and what visibly broke is written under the
 * instance it broke in.
 *
 *   node tools/break.mjs                 # both surfaces, ~46 renders
 *   node tools/break.mjs --only=start    # the start screen alone
 *   node tools/break.mjs --only=chooser  # the app chooser alone
 *   node tools/break.mjs --page-only     # rebuild the page from the last run
 *   node tools/break.mjs --open
 *
 * Output lands in `.demos/break/`, which is gitignored via `.demos/`.
 *
 * ## The two surfaces need two completely different rigs, and both already exist
 *
 * The start screen is a pure function of no arguments producing one
 * self-contained document, so it is rendered with `setContent` and driven
 * through a canned `window.fetch` — exactly the rig in `before-after.mjs`, and
 * the two traps documented there are copied verbatim below because both are
 * silent failures: `addInitScript` does not run for `setContent`, and
 * `location.origin` on `about:blank` is the STRING "null", which makes
 * `new URL(path, location.origin)` throw and sends every route into the page's
 * own network-failure branch.
 *
 * The chooser is TypeScript that needs a context, a bridge and a stylesheet, so
 * it is bundled with esbuild and stood up by its shipped installer — the rig in
 * `chrome-demo.mjs`. That tool's scene file is reused rather than rewritten:
 * `tools/chrome-demo-scene.js` already mounts `installAppChooser` over a real
 * `createContext`, and a second scene that did the same thing slightly
 * differently would be a second thing to keep true. What this file adds on top
 * of it is a panel whose width varies, a config whose app name varies, and a
 * `fetch` that can refuse the switch — none of which the scene has to know
 * about, because all three are installed from the driver after it returns.
 *
 * ## Why the notes are data in this file
 *
 * The page has to read as the report on its own, which means a break is marked
 * under the instance it happened in rather than only in a table at the end. A
 * break is only known after the render, so `NOTES` below is filled in on the
 * second pass and `--page-only` rebuilds the page from `shots.json` without
 * paying for the renders again.

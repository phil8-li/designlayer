/**
 * Every toast the editor raises, on one page, fired through the real toaster.
 *
 * The page bundles `src/core/toast.ts` itself — Sonner, the shadow root, the
 * editor's stylesheet, the durations and the close button — so a card shown
 * here is the card the editor shows. Nothing is mocked but the trigger.
 *
 * Three sections:
 *   - Variants: the kinds of card (info, error, info with Undo, long, stacked).
 *   - Events that toast: every call site, grouped by what the user did.
 *   - Events that stay silent: direct manipulation, by the rule in the header
 *     of `core/toast.ts`.
 *
 * Every event names the file that raises it and a fragment of its wording, and
 * the build fails when a fragment is no longer in that file — so the page
 * cannot quietly drift from the code it documents.
 *
 *   node tools/toast-gallery.mjs          # build .demos/toasts/index.html

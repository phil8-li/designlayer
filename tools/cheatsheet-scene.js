/**
 * The browser half of the interfaces.dev cheat-sheet review page.
 *
 * Bundled — never run — by `tools/cheatsheet-demo.mjs`, once against the
 * working tree and once against a snapshot of the tree as it was before this
 * pass. The two bundles are each other's before and after.
 *
 * ## The one constraint that shapes this file
 *
 * It must compile against BOTH trees. So it may import only things both have:
 * `shellCss`, `toasterCss`, `icon`, `el`, `tokens`. Nothing added by this pass —
 * `arriveFrom`, `type.measure` — may be named here, or the before build fails
 * and the page loses the column that is the whole point of it.
 *
 * ## Why the markup is written here rather than driven out of the panels
 *
 * `tools/chrome-demo.mjs` stands up real installers, and that is the right tool
 * when the thing being compared is a panel's behaviour. Nearly everything on
 * this page is a STYLESHEET delta on a class — a hover plate, a focus ring, a
 * corner, a padding, a keyframe's origin. Standing up an editor, a bridge, a
 * host app and a dev server to arrive at a `.de-button` would put four hundred
 * lines of scaffolding between the reader and the two pixels that changed, and
 * every one of those lines is a place the two columns could differ for a reason
 * that is not the finding.
 *
 * The honesty this trades away is bounded and stated: ONE scene file builds
 * BOTH columns, so the markup is identical by construction and only the
 * stylesheet differs. What it cannot prove is that the product emits this
 * markup — for that, the class names below are the contract, and each scene
 * names the source file it was read from.

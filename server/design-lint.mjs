/**
 * The design-system audit: which checkers this project has, what they found,
 * and the narrow set of findings this editor is willing to rewrite for you.
 *
 * A checker already installed in the project is the only kind worth running.
 * This package ships none of its own and resolves every one of them from the
 * PROJECT's `node_modules`, the way `server/variants.mjs` and
 * `server/react-source.mjs` resolve the host's parser: a linter bundled here
 * would be checking the designer's stylesheet against a configuration nobody in
 * their repository wrote, and would disagree with the `npm run lint` their CI
 * runs. The audit is a second face on the check the project already has, never
 * a second opinion about it.
 *
 * Four decisions shape everything below.
 *
 * A CHECKER IS REPORTED, NEVER ASSUMED. `tools()` answers "will this run, and
 * why" for every checker it knows about, from evidence on disk. The failure
 * this prevents is the one that makes an audit worthless: a checker that
 * silently does not run turns "no issues" into a lie, and the user has no way
 * to see the difference between a clean project and a switched-off rule. So an
 * unavailable checker is still returned, with a sentence saying what is missing.
 *
 * APPLICABILITY IS PART OF AVAILABILITY. One of these checkers reads Tailwind
 * utility classes and nothing else — its own token discovery returns null on a
 * design system built out of custom properties, and its unknown-class rule then
 * reports every ordinary class name in the project as an error. Measured on one
 * real project that was 7,865 errors. Running it there is not a stricter audit;
 * it is a wall of false positives that makes every true finding unfindable, and
 * a user who scrolls past a thousand wrong answers stops believing the right
 * ones. So "applicable to this project" is checked as hard as "installed", and
 * a checker that does not apply says so in plain words.
 *
 * A FINDING NEEDS AN ELEMENT, NOT A LINE. Every one of these tools reports a
 * file and a line, which is all a terminal needs and nothing a canvas can use:
 * there is no line number on screen. So each finding is enriched here with the
 * SELECTOR of the rule whose block it sits in, parsed out of the stylesheet
 * with postcss, and that selector is what the marker layer runs against the
 * live DOM. A finding in a template rather than a stylesheet has no enclosing
 * rule, and says so with a null rather than a guess.
 *
 * A FIX IS ONLY EVER ONE THE TOOL NAMED. These messages carry their own remedy,
 * and only sometimes: "Use var(--x)" and "Did you mean --x?" each name exactly
 * one replacement, while a message listing the nearest few candidates names
 * three guesses. Picking one of three for the user is how an audit silently
 * changes a colour nobody chose — so a finding with no single named token is
 * reported as unfixable and the row says why. An Auto Fix that invents a token
 * is worse than no Auto Fix, because the user stops reading the diff.
 *
 * Each tool runs in a CHILD PROCESS. These are third-party checkers walking the
 * whole project, and this process is the one holding the designer's unsaved
 * state: a linter that throws takes only its own child down, a linter that
 * loops is killed at the deadline instead of hanging the editor, and a linter
 * that leaks memory over a large repository exits with the child. It also makes
 * the 60-second bound real rather than decorative — a synchronous checker
 * cannot be preempted by a `Promise.race` inside the process running it, which
 * is exactly the checker most likely to need the bound.

     * The working directory is part of a checker's configuration, whatever its
     * API says, and getting it wrong is silent.
     *
     * Measured: a token plugin resolves the relative paths in its own
     * `tokenSources` against `process.cwd()` when the linter does not hand it
     * one, so running the same project from somewhere else finds no token file,
     * concludes that every token in the project is undeclared, and reports 2,168
     * errors instead of 19. Nothing in that run looks like a misconfiguration —
     * it looks like a project in terrible shape, which is the worst way for an
     * audit to be wrong.
     *
     * A checker's own `cwd` option is passed as well wherever it takes one. This
     * is the backstop for the ones that quietly do not use it, and it is safe to
     * set here precisely because this is a child: the editor's own process never
     * moves, and a chdir in it would break every relative path the server holds.

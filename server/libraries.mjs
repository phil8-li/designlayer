/**
 * The design-system libraries a project has ADDED, and the pointer file that
 * remembers them.
 *
 * The host's own catalog is resolved once at startup from `designSystem` in the
 * config and frozen into the browser prelude. Libraries are the runtime layer on
 * top of it: a designer points the Libraries tab at a stylesheet, a manifest, a
 * token file, an icon set or a directory of components, and from then on every
 * token-bearing control in the inspector offers what was found there — with no
 * restart, because nothing about a library is compiled into anything.
 *
 * Two decisions shape everything below.
 *
 * WHAT IS PERSISTED IS A POINTER, NEVER A CATALOG — EXCEPT AT A URL.
 * `libraries.json` holds an id, a name, an enabled flag, a source and a
 * timestamp, and `list()` re-reads and re-parses every source on every call.
 * That is what makes an edit to the designer's own token file show up in the
 * inspector without touching the editor. A catalog cached in that file would be
 * a design system frozen at the moment it was added, and the only way to
 * refresh it would be to remove the library and add it back.
 *
 * A URL LIBRARY IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS CACHED FOR THE SAME REASON THE
 * OTHERS ARE NOT. Re-reading a local file costs a `stat` and a parse; re-reading
 * a URL costs a round trip to somebody else's server, and `list()` is called on
 * every panel repaint. Left uncached, every repaint would put a stranger's
 * latency between a designer and their own inspector — and a design system
 * published at a URL does not change while they work, which is exactly the
 * property the local case does not have. So a URL row carries its catalog in
 * `libraries.json` and `update(id, { refresh: true })` is how it is renewed.
 * Local libraries keep re-parsing from disk; that behaviour is load-bearing and
 * must not be "unified" with this one.
 *
 * THE PATH IN AN `add` IS ATTACKER-ADJACENT INPUT. It arrives from a page and
 * becomes a file this process reads on that page's behalf, so `../../etc/passwd`,
 * `/etc/passwd` and a symlink pointing out of the project are three ways to read
 * something the designer never opened. The loopback guard in `routes.mjs` is not
 * an answer to any of them: it establishes that the request came from this
 * machine, not that the path is one the editor may read. Every path goes through
 * `resolveSource` below, which refuses all three as a 400 — a status the panel
 * can turn into "that file is outside your project" rather than "something went
 * wrong".
 *
 * The state directory comes from the resolved config for the reason
 * `server/options-store.mjs` gives: once this package is installed, `../../` is
 * `node_modules/`, and everything the editor persists would land inside a
 * dependency instead of the host project.

/**
 * The bar a stylesheet clears to be OFFERED as a library, and the two shapes
 * that clear it.
 *
 * `detectLibraryKind` answers "can this file be read as a design system?", and
 * four custom properties is the right answer to THAT question: it is the
 * cheapest test that separates a stylesheet carrying tokens from one carrying
 * only rules. It is the wrong answer to the question discovery actually asks,
 * which is "would a designer ever mean this file?". Measured against a real
 * app, the four-property rule finds the project's design system and then a
 * dozen component stylesheets behind it, each declaring the two or three
 * one-off values that one component happened to need. Every one of them parses.
 * None of them is a library, and a chooser whose list is mostly noise is one a
 * designer stops reading — so the noise costs more than the misses do.
 *
 * DISCOVERY IS A RECOMMENDATION; `add` IS A CAPABILITY. Nothing here changes
 * what `add` accepts. A designer who types one of these paths into the manual
 * field still gets the library, because the editor can genuinely read the file
 * and refusing it would be the editor pretending it cannot. The bar governs
 * only what the editor volunteers unasked, which is why it is applied in `scan`
 * and nowhere near `sourceKind`.
 *
 * The bar is read off the PARSED catalog, never off the path. A path rule would
 * be one framework's convention — `*.component.css` is how Angular spells
 * "private stylesheet", and means nothing in a Vue, Svelte or plain-CSS project
 * — and what makes a file a design system is what is inside it.
 *
 * Two ways to clear it, because design systems come in both shapes:
 *
 *  - BREADTH. A system declares more than one axis and gives each one a scale.
 *    The shortest run of values anyone calls a scale is four steps (xs/sm/md/lg
 *    is the near-universal floor), so two axes at four steps each is eight
 *    tokens — the smallest count that is credibly a system rather than a
 *    handful of values one component needed. The component stylesheets this
 *    rule is aimed at carry one to three, so they are not near misses.
 *  - DEPTH. A file may be a single axis and still be a library: a palette is
 *    nothing but colours. With one group there is no second axis corroborating
 *    the claim, so the count has to carry it alone and the bar is higher.
 *    Twenty-four is a palette enumerated on purpose — eight hues in three
 *    shades, or a twelve-step ramp declared for light and again for dark —
 *    where a dozen colours is still what one busy component declares inline.

 * rather than an accident — and a component directory had to pass

 * any JSON with a nested `{ value: … }` leaf, which is also the shape of an i18n
 * catalog, a Cypress fixture and a chart's data file — and `tokens` outranks
 * `css`, so `locales/en.json` was offered at the TOP of the list, describing
 * itself as "no tokens", above the project's real `src/styles/tokens.css`. A
 * candidate that parses to nothing is not a small design system, it is a file
 * that answered the detector's question by accident. Judging it on its parsed
 * catalog rather than on a tighter detector keeps the rule where every other
 * rule in this file already is: what makes a file a design system is what is
 * inside it.
 *
 * Exported because `server/design-system-detect.mjs` reads the same parsed

 * from a whole tree: a lone list of a dozen colours could be a palette or could
 * be one busy component, and with nothing else to go on the count has to settle
 * it.
 *
 * The detector is not choosing from a tree. It has already been told where to
 * look — `src/index.css`, `app/globals.css`, or whatever `components.json`
 * names as the Tailwind entry — and a stylesheet at that path is the one the
 * BUILD treats as the project's own. That is the corroborating signal the depth
 * bar was standing in for, and it is a better signal than any count: a
 * component's private stylesheet is never the configured entry point.
 *
 * Applying the strict bar there rejected real projects. Measured across four
 * prototypes whose tokens live in `src/index.css`, two were adopted and two were
 * refused for declaring a palette and nothing else — thirteen colours in one,
 * seven in the other, both inside an explicit theme block with the words "Design
 * tokens" written above them. The editor then offered no tokens at all for a
 * project that plainly had them, which is the exact failure this detection was
 * added to end.
 *
 * So the only bar left is emptiness. A file that parses to nothing is still
 * nothing — which is what keeps a CSS reset, or an entry that does no more than
 * `@import` a framework, from being adopted — but a conventional entry that

/**
 * The Libraries tab's six verbs, grouped for the same reason the Angular pair
 * is: the id-bearing forms need two patterns plus an ordering rule between them,
 * and inlining that into `route` buries the rule where the next edit will step
 * on it.
 *
 * The rule: `/libraries/available` is a literal segment that also satisfies the
 * id pattern, so it has to be tested BEFORE the `<id>` forms or a scan answers
 * as a lookup for a library nobody added.
 *
 * Drawings have their own endpoint rather than riding along in `GET /libraries`
 * because they are path data — the reason `server/icon-set.mjs` serves the
 * host's own set on request instead of shipping it in the prelude. The panel
 * lists libraries on every refresh and opens the icon picker almost never.
 *
 * Path safety lives in the store, not here. The loopback guard `handle` applies
 * says the request came from this machine; it says nothing about whether the
 * `path` in the body is one this process may read, and only the store knows
 * where the project root is. The same applies to the `url` a POST may carry
 * instead of a `path`: whether it is a fetchable web address is the store's
 * question, and a second opinion here is one more thing to keep in step.
 *
 * The bodies are passed through whole for that reason. A POST is `{ path }` or
 * `{ url }`, and a PATCH is any of `{ enabled }`, `{ name }` or
 * `{ refresh: true }` — this layer checks only that it was handed an object,
 * because every rule about what is IN that object lives one module down.

   * Where to point a coding agent, and whether one has turned up.
   *
   * The whole of MCP setup, as far as a designer is concerned, is one URL that
   * has to get into their agent's config file — and then the question nobody
   * could previously answer from inside the editor: did that work? The launcher
   * prints the URL once at startup, in a terminal most designers never see, and
   * the browser is deliberately unable to probe the MCP port itself (`mcp.mjs`
   * refuses a non-JSON content type precisely so a page cannot reach it). So
   * this route relays what the server already knows.
   *
   * `connected` is latched and `waiting` is not, and the pair is what makes an
   * honest status line. An agent parked in `wait_for_change` shows as waiting;
   * an agent that is attached but mid-turn shows as connected-but-not-waiting,
   * which is a working setup and must not read as a broken one. Reporting only
   * `waiting` would have the panel flicker to "disconnected" every time the
   * agent went off to do the work it was just asked for.
   *
   * `url` is null when the port never bound — taken, or disabled by config —
   * and the panel says that instead of printing an address nothing answers.

/**
 * Signing in to a walled design system by opening the SITE'S OWN sign-in, in a
 * real browser window, and keeping whatever session that produces.
 *
 * ## The thing this replaces
 *
 * `library-auth.mjs` explains the gap: the editor's Node process fetches the
 * library URL and holds none of the designer's sessions. The first answer to
 * that gap was to ask the designer for a credential — paste a bearer token, or
 * paste a Cookie header out of dev tools.
 *
 * That answer asks the wrong person. A designer who pastes a private Storybook
 * link is not holding a token and usually has no supported way to get one.
 * Behind an SSO proxy the tooling that mints tokens is frequently built for
 * automation rather than for people, and will refuse to issue one against a
 * human account at all — which leaves copying a session cookie out of dev
 * tools, or standing up an OAuth client to mint against. Both are a small
 * infrastructure project standing between a person and a component list, and
 * both make this editor the keeper of a credential system it has no business
 * owning.
 *
 * The site already has a sign-in. It is the one the designer uses every day, it
 * knows how to do two-factor and device policy and account choosing, and it is
 * the only party entitled to decide whether this person gets in. So this module
 * does not ask for a credential. It opens that sign-in and waits.
 *
 * ## The measurement that settles it
 *
 * Driven against a real proxy-protected Storybook, the DevTools protocol
 * reports every cookie in the exchange — the proxy's own nonce on the target
 * origin, and the identity provider's session cookies at the host it bounced to
 * — as `httpOnly=true; secure=true`. Meanwhile `document.cookie`, evaluated in
 * that same page, returns the empty string.
 *
 * A flow that asks somebody to paste their session is therefore asking for a
 * value no page can read and most people cannot reach — while a browser hands
 * the same value over in one call. That is not a preference between two
 * designs; one of them cannot be completed by the person it is addressed to.
 *
 * ## The flow
 *
 *   launch a browser the editor owns -> open the library URL in it ->
 *   the site's own sign-in appears -> the person signs in as they always do ->
 *   the page lands back on the target origin -> take the session cookies for
 *   that origin -> verify them -> store them -> retry the fetch
 *
 * Only the middle step involves the designer, and it is the step they already
 * know how to do. Nothing is typed into this editor.
 *
 * ## Why a separate browser profile rather than theirs
 *
 * Chrome will not accept a debugging connection into a profile that is already
 * running, and taking over the browser somebody has their work in is rude even
 * when it is possible. A profile of our own under the editor's state directory
 * also means the session is remembered: sign in to an origin once and every
 * later library on that origin — and every later run of the editor — is already
 * through. That is the difference between a sign-in and a chore.
 *
 * ## Why the DevTools protocol rather than a browser-automation dependency
 *
 * Two reasons, and the second is the one that matters here. It adds no
 * dependency to a package that ships to other people's machines — `ws` is
 * already in this tree. And it drives the browser the person already has
 * installed, signed by its own vendor, rather than a browser build downloaded
 * at install time — which on a centrally managed machine is precisely the kind
 * of unrecognised binary that software policy blocks from running, and a
 * centrally managed machine behind an SSO proxy is exactly the case this
 * feature exists for.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * No token minting, no OAuth client id of our own, no refresh logic. When the
 * session expires the site says so, the wall comes back, and the same window
 * opens again — usually landing straight through, because the browser profile
 * still holds the identity provider's own session. The provider decides how
 * long a session lasts, which is the correct place for that decision to live.

 * PUT THE SIGN-IN WINDOW IN FRONT OF THE PERSON, which is the whole feature.
 *
 * A window nobody can see is the same as no window. The panel says "waiting for
 * the sign-in", the designer looks at an unchanged screen, and after a while
 * they conclude the button is broken — which is exactly the report that sent
 * this rewrite: *"when I click Sign in with Google, it just shows me Wait,
 * nothing pops up."*
 *
 * ## What was measured
 *
 * The window was there the whole time. Asked over the DevTools protocol, the
 * stranded instance answered:
 *
 *   bounds {left: 22, top: 30, width: 520, height: 720}, windowState "normal"
 *   document.visibilityState "visible", document.hidden false
 *   document.hasFocus() FALSE
 *
 * On screen, correct size, correct URL, painting — and behind everything else
 * the person had open.
 *
 * ## Why the old call could not have worked
 *
 * It ran `open -a "/Applications/Google Chrome.app"`. That activates an
 * APPLICATION, identified by its bundle — and the designer is already running
 * that same bundle with their own profile. macOS has no idea the caller meant
 * the second instance, so it brings the person's ordinary browser window
 * forward and leaves the sign-in window exactly where it was. On the machines
 * where this feature matters most, that is every time: nobody who needs to sign
 * in to a private Storybook has no browser open.
 *
 * ## What works
 *
 * Activate the PROCESS, by its pid. `System Events` addresses a running process
 * by `unix id`, which is the one handle that distinguishes our Chrome from
 * theirs — verified against the stranded window above, which went to
 * `hasFocus() === true` on the first try.
 *
 * `Page.bringToFront` stays and runs first: it raises the right TAB inside the
 * process, and the activation then raises the process. Neither does the other's
 * job.
 *
 * Retried a few times because a window that is still being created cannot be
 * raised, and the launch-to-paint gap is exactly where this is called.
 *
 * ## Why every attempt is on a stopwatch
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment claimed the activation "needs no
 * Automation permission for a process the same user launched". That is true of
 * the Accessibility API and false of Apple events, which is what this is:
 * addressing another application from an unbundled `node` crosses a privacy
 * boundary and the operating system asks the person's permission first,
 * attributing the request to whichever terminal or launcher owns this process.
 * Until that question is answered the helper simply does not exit — and the
 * question is asked in a dialog that opens behind other windows, which is the
 * exact failure this function exists to correct, so it is never answered.
 *
 * Hence `RAISE_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT` and a SIGKILL rather than a wait: a child that
 * has not finished raising a window in a second and a half is not raising one,

     * Chrome normally shows an `alert`, `confirm` or `beforeunload` itself and
     * the renderer waits for the person to dismiss it. With the Page domain
     * enabled, it stops doing that: the dialog is reported to the client as
     * `Page.javascriptDialogOpening` and the renderer stays blocked until the
     * client answers with `Page.handleJavaScriptDialog`. Nothing here ever did,
     * so one dialog anywhere in a sign-in chain — a `beforeunload` on a partly
     * filled form, a provider's "are you still there" — stopped the page dead.
     * `Runtime.evaluate` against a blocked renderer never answers, which is
     * precisely the shape of hang the timeout above was written for.
     *
     * DISMISSED, EXCEPT FOR `beforeunload`, and that exception is a bug fix
     * rather than an inconsistency.
     *
     * Dismissing everything was the first version, on the reasoning that these
     * dialogs belong to the site and answering "yes" on somebody's behalf is a
     * decision this editor has no business making. That reasoning is right for
     * `confirm` and `prompt` — a question with two real answers, where the
     * conservative one is to decline — and it is exactly backwards for
     * `beforeunload`, because `beforeunload` is not a question about the page.
     * It is a confirmation of a NAVIGATION, and dismissing it means "stay here":
     * it cancels the very thing that was just asked for.
     *
     * Both halves of this flow ask for navigations. `Page.navigate` below is
     * one, and a dismissal silently turns it into nothing — the command still
     * resolves, no new document ever arrives, and the run burns its whole
     * ceiling on a page it believes it asked to leave. The person's own clicks
     * are the other and the worse one: they press the provider's Continue
     * button, the login page's unload guard fires, this handler answers "stay",
     * and nothing happens. They press it again. Nothing happens again. They
     * cannot answer the dialog themselves, because enabling the Page domain took
     * that away from them, so the window sits live, focused and unusable until
     * the ceiling kills it.
     *
     * `alert` stays on the dismissing side purely because there is nothing to
     * choose: an alert has one button, and the protocol closes it either way.
     *
     * Registered BEFORE `Page.enable`, not after it, and the ordering is a bug
     * a test caught rather than a preference. Chrome may report a dialog on the
     * document that is already loading the instant the domain comes up, and a
     * listener attached one await later misses it — leaving exactly the frozen
     * renderer this is here to prevent, in the one case hardest to reproduce.

     * 200 carrying a password input. Importing it rather than sniffing for a

     * copy would be the version that never learns about the next shape, and the
     * two would disagree about the same page, which is the bug above wearing a
     * different hat.
     *
     * The live DOM is what gets classified, not the response body. It costs one
     * evaluation, it is already the thing being polled, and it sees a login form
     * that a framework rendered on the client — which a body read cannot.

     * TWO PASSES, and the first is the reason this is worth writing. The
     * profile remembers the identity provider's own session, so the second
     * library behind the same SSO — and every library after a restart, until
     * the provider expires it — needs no interaction at all. A silent pass
     * catches exactly those cases: it opens the same profile with no window,
     * follows the redirects, and if the site lets it through, the designer
     * never sees anything. Only a pass that ends up sitting on a login page
     * opens a real window and asks for a human.
     *
     * Doing it the other way round — always show the window, close it when it
     * turns out to be unnecessary — is the same mechanism and a much worse
     * experience: a window that appears and vanishes reads as a glitch, and it
     * steals focus from whatever the designer was doing to do it.
     *
     * ## ONE DEADLINE FOR THE WHOLE CALL, and why there has to be one
     *
     * Two passes, each with a ceiling, is not a budget. Every phase inside a
     * pass used to be bounded on its own and counted against nothing, so the
     * real worst case was the SUM of a dozen independent bounds — two launches,
     * two attaches, a window raise that retried three times, a handful of
     * commands, a cookie read, two teardowns, plus the two poll loops — which
     * added up to roughly fifteen minutes against an advertised four. Nothing
     * upstream rescues that, either: Node stops applying its request timeout
     * once the request body has arrived, so a wedged run holds the socket, the
     * panel and the person for as long as it likes.
     *
     * So the deadline is computed HERE, once, as an absolute timestamp, and
     * threaded into both passes. Every phase inside `runWindow` clamps to it
     * rather than to a share of it, which keeps a slow-but-legitimate launch
     * from stealing the cookie read's budget while still making the total
     * inescapable. The call can overrun it by at most whatever single bounded
     * operation was in flight when it passed — one command and one teardown, a
     * shade under twenty seconds — and not by a second more.
     *
     * The arithmetic is deliberately the sum of the parts the caller can see:
     * the silent pass's ceiling, the window's own ceiling (the four minutes a
     * person is given, or whatever the caller asked for instead), and one
     * allowance for everything that is not waiting for a person. A caller that
     * wants a different total says so with `totalTimeoutMs`.

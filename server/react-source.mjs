/**
 * Deleting a JSX element from a React source file, and putting one in.
 *
 * Every other React edit this package makes goes through the vendored engine,
 * whose jscodeshift transformer knows three verbs: change a className, change
 * some text, reorder two siblings. Removing an element is not among them and
 * cannot be expressed as any of them, so this is the one React write the
 * package performs itself — and inserting one, which arrived with the assets
 * panel, is the second. The two share everything but their splice: the same
 * path resolution, the same per-file batching, the same partial-failure report.
 *
 * It is a byte-range splice, not a codemod, and that is the point. jscodeshift
 * REPRINTS the file it edits; on a file whose formatting nobody asked to change,
 * a one-element deletion can come back as a diff touching two hundred lines.
 * Taking exactly the element's own bytes out leaves everything else — the
 * author's line breaks, their quote style, their trailing commas — untouched.
 *
 * What it refuses is as important as what it does. An element is removable only
 * when it sits in another element's CHILDREN, because that is the only position
 * whose syntax survives the bytes going away:
 *
 *   <div><Card /></div>              removable — the div keeps standing
 *   return <Card />                  refused — `return ;` is not valid
 *   {open && <Card />}               refused — `{open && }` is not valid
 *   items.map(() => <Card />)        refused — the arrow would return nothing
 *
 * The refusals are reported by reason. A user who tries to delete a component's
 * root element is told that is what it is, and the change stays on screen as a
 * preview with a line in the Prompts tab — the same ending every other change
 * this editor cannot write has.
 *
 * Insertion has one refusal of its own, and it is about the import rather than
 * the markup. A `<Button/>` spliced into a file that does not import `Button`
 * compiles to nothing and shows nothing, so the import is not a follow-up step
 * — it is part of the same splice, and an operation that cannot write it does
 * not write the markup either.

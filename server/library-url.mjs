/**
 * A design system that lives at a URL instead of in the project.
 *
 * Every other library kind names a file this process can open. This one names a
 * page somebody published — a Storybook, a documentation site, a token file
 * served over HTTP — and the whole of the designer's input is a URL they
 * pasted out of their address bar. That single difference drives everything
 * below, because the address bar is not a file picker: the URL is almost never
 * the catalog, it is a page NEAR the catalog, and this module's job is to work
 * out what the catalog is from a deep link into a component's docs.
 *
 * THE URL IS CARRIED IN `source.path`, NOT IN A NEW FIELD. A library's source
 * is `{ kind, path }` everywhere — the client reads `library.source.path` into
 * the row, `libraries.mjs` dedupes on it, `libraryId` slugs it, and the removal
 * path matches on it. Giving a URL library a `source.url` would mean touching
 * every one of those for a value that is already a string identifying where the
 * library came from. So a URL library spells itself `{ kind: "url", path: "<the
 * url>" }` and no existing consumer had to learn anything. The next reader will
 * want to "fix" this; the fix is four files of churn and one new way for a row
 * to go missing.
 *
 * SIGN-IN IS THE NORMAL CASE, NOT AN EDGE CASE. Most component catalogs worth
 * pointing this at are internal to some organisation, and a refused request
 * mostly does not fail the way a refused request is supposed to. A plain
 * `fetch` that follows redirects gets HTTP 200 and a body — and the body is a
 * login page. Parsed, that is a "library" containing somebody's sign-in form,
 * installed with a green checkmark, and the designer has no way to see what
 * went wrong. `looksLikeSsoWall` exists for exactly that failure, and it reads
 * the BODY as well as the redirect because following the redirect is what hides
 * the 302 in the first place. `library-auth.mjs` owns the rules, all of which
 * are HTTP or OAuth standards rather than facts about one vendor.
 *
 * EVERY NETWORK CALL IS INJECTABLE. `fetchImpl` and `runHelper` are options with
 * real defaults rather than imports, so the test suite runs offline against
 * fakes. A module that reached for `globalThis.fetch` directly could only be
 * tested by a suite that was allowed to talk to the internet, which is a suite
 * that fails on a plane and passes when the site it points at changes.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the filesystem or the store. Reading a catalog out of
 * text is `library-sources.mjs`'s job and it is reused rather than
 * reimplemented — a second DTCG parser is how a token file served over HTTP
 * comes to be understood differently from the same file on disk.

 * `<link rel=stylesheet>` inserted later by script this module never runs. And
 * `<base href>` moves what a relative href means, so a document that sets one
 * and is read without it resolves every link against the wrong directory.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS PART OF THE ANSWER, because the fetch budget is smaller than
 * this list is allowed to be. A `media="print"` sheet is not the design system
 * by definition, so it is dropped outright; a sheet the page only applies in
 * dark is real but cannot be read as the default palette, so it sorts last,
 * where the merge's first-wins rule leaves it able to ADD names and unable to

 * dark. Last-wins would hand every one of those decisions to whichever sheet
 * happened to be listed last, which is the bug this replaces wearing different
 * clothes.
 *
 * A variable is claimed by its cssVar as well as by its token id, so two sheets
 * that shorten `--acme-color-brand` and `--color-brand` onto the same label do
 * not both appear, and one that declares the same variable under two labels

/**
 * Whether a candidate preview document is really just the site's app shell.
 *
 * A single-page application serves one HTML shell for every path it does not
 * recognise, with a 200. So `…/avatar/preview.html` comes back looking exactly
 * as successful as a real preview document does, and it carries the MANAGER's
 * stylesheet — the tool's own chrome. Walked deepest-first, those decoys are
 * reached before the real `/preview.html` at the origin, so the first
 * stylesheet collected was Tailwind's stock palette and the genuine design
 * system never got a look in. Observed exactly that way: fifty colours named
 * `amber-50` where the answer was eighty-two named `surface`.
 *
 * Two tests, because the cheap one is defeated by one varying byte. Identical
 * text is what "serves the same page for every path" means in the simple case,
 * and it costs nothing to check. But a shell carrying a CSP nonce, a CSRF
 * token, an inlined build id or a server timestamp is a DIFFERENT document on
 * every request while still being the same shell — and the whole defence used
 * to fall over on that. So a candidate linking exactly the same stylesheets, in
 * the same order, as the page is also treated as the shell. That test cannot
 * cost anything either: if it is wrong and the candidate was a real preview, it
 * links the same sheets the page does and the page contributes them anyway.

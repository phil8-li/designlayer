/**
 * A Model Context Protocol server, so the designer's "Send to agent" button
 * lands inside a coding agent's turn instead of on the clipboard.
 *
 * ## Why the editor is the server
 *
 * It reads backwards — the editor is the thing with a UI, the agent is the
 * thing doing the work — but MCP's roles are about who offers context, not who
 * has a window. The agent is the client; whatever it reads from is a server.
 * Every other tool that has tried this (stagewise, after two rewrites, and
 * Agentation) arrived at the same inversion.
 *
 * ## Why a tool blocks
 *
 * A server has no way to start an agent's turn. It may answer requests, and it
 * may send notifications about its own lists going stale, and that is the
 * whole surface. So the handoff is a pull the agent parked earlier:
 * `wait_for_change` does not return until the designer presses the button.
 *
 * ## Why this is hand-rolled
 *
 * Streamable HTTP with no server-initiated traffic is JSON-RPC 2.0 over a
 * single POST, and the spec explicitly permits answering `application/json`
 * instead of opening an SSE stream. That is ~200 lines against a dependency
 * tree with its own protocol version to track, in a package that ships four
 * runtime dependencies on purpose and pins the one that matters exactly.
 *
 * The cost is real and worth naming: with no SSE stream there is nowhere to put
 * progress notifications, so a block cannot outlive the client's request
 * timeout. Clients default to 60s. `wait_for_change` therefore caps at 55s and
 * says, in the one place a model will read it, to call again — a loop of short
 * waits is indistinguishable from one long one, and cannot strand a watcher.

/**
 * The focus ring belongs to the keyboard, and to nothing else.
 *
 * The editor forces focus on every pointerdown over its own chrome, because the
 * vendor's document guard eats the native default action. That force is script
 * focus, and an engine reading a script focus keeps `:focus-visible` on — which
 * is how every button a designer CLICKED came to wear the 2px accent ring that
 * is supposed to mean "you are navigating by keyboard".
 *
 * These cases pin the two halves of the answer in `core/focus`: the modality
 * handed to each focus call, and the live rule that covers the control which
 * was already focused when the click landed. They also re-read the stylesheets,
 * because the whole design rests on every ring being keyed on `:focus-visible`
 * — one bare `:focus { outline }` anywhere and the modality is moot.

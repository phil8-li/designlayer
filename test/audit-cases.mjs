/**
 * The audit's server half: which checkers a project may run, what a finding is,
 * and what may be written back into a designer's stylesheet.
 *
 * Everything here runs against a REAL project created under `os.tmpdir()` and
 * thrown away afterwards, with the routes driven over a real `http.createServer`
 * on 127.0.0.1 — the same harness `library-store-cases.mjs` uses, for the same
 * reason. Three of the claims below are facts about bytes on disk (an edit moves
 * a finding, a splice leaves the rest of the file alone, an ignore survives a
 * restart), and a fake filesystem cannot prove any of them.
 *
 * The linters themselves are SYNTHETIC. `node_modules/stylelint` here is forty
 * lines written for this file that scan the fixture stylesheets for four
 * literals and report them at the positions they really occupy. That is not a
 * shortcut around installing the real one — it is the only way to pin the thing
 * that matters, which is how the audit treats a MESSAGE. The real linter's
 * sentence is the entire input to the fix decision, and a test that could not
 * choose which sentence comes back could not tell the three kinds apart. The
 * stub's positions are real, so a re-read after an edit moves them exactly as
 * the real tool would, and nothing downstream of the message is faked.
 *
 * What is worth pinning, and why each one is a way this feature goes quietly
 * wrong:
 *
 *  - **shadcn must report unavailable, with a reason naming Tailwind, on a
 *    project that is not a Tailwind project.** This is the most important case
 *    in the file and it is not a style preference. `@shadcn/lint` is Tailwind-
 *    only by construction: its own token discovery returns null against a
 *    custom-property design system, and its unknown-class rule flagged 7,865
 *    ordinary class names as errors on one real project. An audit that turns it
 *    on there does not become stricter, it becomes a wall of false positives,
 *    and the cost is not a bad number — it is that nobody opens the panel
 *    again. The mirror case runs the same check against a project that DOES use
 *    Tailwind, because "always unavailable" would pass the first case while
 *    removing the checker entirely;
 *  - **a finding's `id` must not move when a line above it does.** The id is
 *    what an ignore is stored against. Hash the line number into it and every
 *    ignore in a file resurrects the moment someone adds an import at the top —
 *    silently, and worst for the person who dismissed the most. So the case
 *    edits a line ABOVE a finding, asserts the ids are unchanged, and asserts
 *    the line numbers DID move, because otherwise it proves only that nothing
 *    happened;
 *  - **`fix` is null for a message that only lists candidates.** Three of the
 *    four messages here name a replacement and one lists `Nearest: --a, --b,
 *    --c`. Choosing one of three guesses for the user is how a linter silently
 *    changes a colour nobody chose, and the damage is invisible in review
 *    because the diff looks exactly like a correct fix;
 *  - **a fix is a splice, and everything else in the file is untouched.** The
 *    assertion is byte equality against the original with one replacement
 *    applied, not "the token is now present" — a rewrite that reformats the
 *    file while fixing it would pass the weaker check and lose a designer's
 *    hand-written comments;
 *  - **a finding whose snippet has moved is reported failed, never written.**
 *    The file changed under us. A blind splice at a stale range corrupts a
 *    working stylesheet, and the failure mode of getting this wrong is not a
 *    missed fix, it is a broken page;
 *  - **an ignore is returned flagged, not filtered.** A run that drops ignored
 *    findings server-side makes an ignore impossible to undo, because the panel
 *    can only offer "Unignore" for a row it can still see;
 *  - **one tool crashing keeps the other's findings.** The stub `ds-lint`
 *    throws from every entry point it has. Losing the whole run to it would
 *    turn one broken dependency into an audit that reports a clean project.
 *
 * The fixtures are invented — two stylesheets and four literals written for
 * this file. They exercise the SHAPES the contract measured (a literal with a
 * near-identical token, a literal with nothing close, an undeclared token with
 * one obvious neighbour, the same literal twice in one declaration) without any
 * real design system's values in them.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/audit-cases.mjs

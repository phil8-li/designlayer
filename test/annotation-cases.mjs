/**
 * Annotations: what a note remembers, what an edit remembers, and what the two
 * of them say to an agent.
 *
 * Everything else in this editor produces a change. An annotation produces a
 * SENTENCE, and a sentence has no visible consequence — nothing repaints wrong
 * when the subsystem lies. That is the whole reason this suite is long: every
 * claim below is one that breaks in silence, with the panel still full of pins
 * and the brief still landing on the clipboard.
 *
 * THE STORE. A note is persisted, and a note holds a live DOM node it must
 * never persist: a rehydrated marker that re-attached itself to whatever now
 * sits at that selector is a note about something nobody wrote. Notes are keyed
 * per pathname, so `/pricing` and `/settings` can never pool into one list.
 * `hideUntilRestart` is written out with the rest of the settings and refused on
 * read, because a session that started with every marker hidden is
 * indistinguishable from a build that shipped broken. And a settings blob from
 * an older build is missing keys rather than wrong ones, so it merges over the
 * defaults instead of blanking them.
 *
 * THE JOURNAL. Three facts an agent acts on. A drag across three hundred frames
 * is ONE edit that started where the element started — a journal that kept the
 * last frame's `from` hands over a diff from a value to itself. `written` is the
 * field that says whether re-applying would conflict, so promoting a
 * preview-only edit to written is how an agent skips the only work still owed to
 * source. And an edit the designer took back with Cmd+Z must leave: an outbox
 * that asks for a change the designer explicitly reversed is the single worst
 * thing this feature can do, because it is wrong in the direction that destroys
 * trust in both halves of the panel at once.
 *
 * THE OUTPUT. The brief is the product. It has to interleave notes and edits in
 * the order they happened, separate what is already in the file from what is
 * still only pixels, mean something different at each of its four detail levels,
 * and never carry `/Users/<name>/` into a screen-share. The selector has to pick
 * one of two sibling buttons rather than the first of them, which is how a note
 * on Cancel comes to read as a note on Save.
 *
 * THE CANVAS, as far as jsdom can be asked. Inert while the mode is off; one
 * click is one note; a pin is clickable through an inert layer; blocking is what
 * lets a menu item be annotated at all; and the editor never annotates its own
 * chrome, which would be an infinite regress with a marker at the bottom of it.
 *
 * HOST PARITY. `src/core/config.ts` freezes the framework at module load, so a
 * host cannot be swapped at runtime and this has to load the bundle twice —
 * `host-parity-cases.mjs` documents the same constraint and solves it the same
 * way. Telling an Angular developer to open a React component names a file that
 * was never going to exist, and reads as a brief about a different application.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/annotation-cases.mjs

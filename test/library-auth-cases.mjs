/**
 * Signing the editor in to a design system that is behind a sign-in wall: how
 * the wall is READ, what a credential becomes on the wire, where the secret is
 * kept, and the rules the store will not bend.
 *
 * `library-url-cases.mjs` pins the fetching; this suite pins the half that only
 * exists because the fetch was refused. Five things are worth asserting here
 * and nowhere else:
 *
 *  - **a refusal is an instruction, not a dead end.** Every rule in
 *    `classifyWall` is an HTTP or OAuth standard rather than a fact about one
 *    company's stack, so the cases below are built out of standards too: a
 *    `WWW-Authenticate` challenge (RFC 7235), an authorization request carrying
 *    `response_type` and `client_id` (RFC 6749 §4.1.1), an ordinary sign-in
 *    bounce, a 403. The OAuth case is the one that carries a payload: the
 *    `client_id` in the redirect is the AUDIENCE an identity token has to be
 *    minted for, nothing else in the exchange names it, and a classifier that
 *    drops it leaves a designer needing a string they have no way to look up;
 *  - **cross-origin is the whole boundary.** An app redirecting to its own
 *    `/login` is routing; being sent to somebody else's host is a handoff to an
 *    identity provider. Both are 302s to a sign-in-shaped path, so the origin
 *    comparison is the only thing telling them apart — and reading the first as
 *    a wall would refuse to install perfectly public sites that happen to have
 *    a login page;
 *  - **a 200 is not proof of anything.** `fetch` follows redirects, so by the
 *    time a caller sees a response the 302 that explains it is gone and all
 *    that is left is a successful-looking page of login HTML. Left unread, the
 *    editor installs somebody's sign-in form as a design system with a green
 *    checkmark next to it;
 *  - **`credentialHeaders` is a header-injection guard wearing the clothes of a
 *    formatter.** A scheme it does not recognise would otherwise be a header
 *    name of the caller's choosing in a process that talks to arbitrary hosts,
 *    so the unknown-scheme case asserts an EMPTY object rather than a falsy one;
 *  - **a credential goes to its own origin and nowhere else.** A redirect can
 *    point at a host the designer has never heard of, and a bearer token
 *    forwarded across that hop is a token handed to a stranger. Browsers strip
 *    `Authorization` on a cross-origin redirect; this module follows redirects
 *    by hand, so the check is its own to make and its own to prove.
 *
 * Everything runs offline against a real temp directory. `fetchImpl` and
 * `runHelper` are injected, the credential file is a real 0600 file, and the
 * store is a real `createLibraryStore` — a fake filesystem could not prove the
 * two facts most worth proving, which are that the secret is on disk in its own
 * file and that a swept row is gone from the one the editor re-reads.
 *
 * Every host below is a documentation domain reserved by RFC 2606 and RFC 6761,
 * and the OAuth client id is invented. Nothing here names a real site, and
 * nothing here is a credential anybody holds.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/library-auth-cases.mjs

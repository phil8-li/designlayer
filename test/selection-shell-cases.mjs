 * hand-authored paths kept in agreement by eye, which is how the two ended up
 * reading as different marks at their two sizes.
 *
 * The filled weight in both, because each is the editor claiming the pointer:
 * the switch fills while it is holding your clicks, and the disc only ever
 * exists in order to take them back.
 *
 * There was a third, and it went with the morph that needed it.
 * `.de-toolbar-mark` was the face the pill wore once it had become the disc: it
 * faded up inside the collapsing bar and landed directly underneath the
 * launcher, which crossfaded onto the same pixels. Two discs occupying one
 * place for the last stretch of a morph is invisible only while they are the
 * same drawing, so that mark needed this agreement harder than either surface
 * left here does. The bar fades where it stands now and no glyph of its own
 * fades up inside it, so there is no third drawing to hold to anything.
 *
 * The size comparison went with it, and had to. It read the mark against the
 * disc rather than against a literal, which was right while the two were the
 * same glyph a frame apart; these two are `tokens.icon.launcher` and
 * `tokens.icon.control` and are SUPPOSED to differ by a rung, because one sits
 * alone on a disc and the other in a row of eight. What is left is the drawing
 * and the weight, which is the whole of what the eye reads as the same mark.
 *
 * Which weight is showing is read off the root `fill`, never off the path data
 * alone. That has now been wrong in both directions. Comparing `d` told the two
 * weights apart while the set drew a separate silhouette for each, and then
 * stopped meaning anything when the family became strokes and every glyph
 * reported itself filled — a test that cannot fail rather than one that passes.
 *
 * `Cursor` is native now, and its two weights are two drawings again, for a
 * reason neither earlier set had: a native outline is an even-odd ANNULUS that
 * states its own fill, so the root flood paints nothing over it. What keeps
 * that from being the old drift is the shape of the pair — the hollow weight is
 * the solid one with a second subpath punched out of it, so the solid `d` is a
 * PREFIX of the hollow `d` and the two share an outer boundary by construction
 * rather than by agreement. That is what is asserted below.

 * property the APP is laid out by, and reduced motion keeps a fade instead of
 * keeping nothing. How it FEELS is a question for the browser.
 *
 * Two bans, and they are held for different reasons. The insets — the padding
 * the chrome pushes into the page — are what the app is actually laid out by,
 * and transitioning one relayouts somebody else's product on every frame of
 * ours. A surface's own `width` or `height` costs the app nothing, since every
 * one of these is `position: fixed` and out of its flow; it is banned because
 * animating a box is a layout per frame to draw something `transform` and
 * `opacity` hand to the compositor, and because nothing here needs it.
 *
 * The second ban was repealed for exactly one rule, and is reinstated with the
 * morph it was granted to. That morph — the pill contracting to a 44px disc —
 * genuinely could not be written any other way: a non-uniform `scale` squashes
 * the radius into an ellipse and drags the shadow out of round with it, and a
 * `clip-path` wipe throws the cast away entirely, so both animate a picture of
 * the disc rather than the disc. The bar fades where it stands now, which costs
 * no box at all, so the exemption has nothing left to buy and the loop below is
 * absolute again: every hidden-state rule, the bar's included. An exemption
 * kept past the thing that needed it is how a panel comes to animate its own
 * width on the strength of an argument about a pill.

 * The bar leaves on opacity, and on nothing else.
 *
 * This case has said three things about one rule. It began as "it does not
 * move, at all, in either axis". The morph repealed exactly that much — a pill
 * that BECOMES the disc has to carry itself to wherever the disc is parked, in
 * both axes, because an object turning into another object has to go where it
 * is going. The morph has been reverted, so the original claim is back, and it
 * is now the whole claim: the bar fades where it stands, and each way it could
 * move is banned rather than merely unused.
 *
 * Three failure modes, and every one of them has happened:
 *
 *  - a `translateY` through the bottom edge, alongside the panels sliding out
 *    to theirs. Three surfaces leaving by three different edges is one motion
 *    too many for a toggle pressed this often, and the bar is the one with no
 *    edge of its own to leave by — it is centred over the app, not docked to
 *    anything;
 *  - `transform` in its transition list, which would animate the centring
 *    offset itself — `translateX(-50%)` lives on that property, so the bar
 *    would slide sideways as the canvas widened under it. That is why the
 *    morph's trip was written as the standalone `translate` property, and it is
 *    why `translate` is banned here now that there is no trip: the two
 *    properties are the two doors the same wrongness comes back through;
 *  - the centring inset changing underneath it, which is the subtle one. The
 *    bar is centred on the CANVAS, the canvas widens the instant the chrome
 *    hides, and sharing `--de-left`/`--de-right` with the app's padding made
 *    the bar jump sideways at full opacity before the fade had even started.
 *    The drop used to cover that up; a fade does not, which is what the second
 *    half of this case, at the bottom, is for.
 *
 * `width`, `height` and `border-radius` are banned one layer down from the case
 * above: that one forbids TRANSITIONING a box, this one forbids the hidden
 * state declaring a different box at all. A 44px `width` left here with nothing
 * animating it is not half a morph, it is a pill that snaps to a disc in one
 * frame and then fades — worse than either design, and exactly the wreckage a
 * partial revert leaves.
 *
 * Two assertions on the base rule went with the morph as well. One pinned
 * `width: var(--de-toolbar-width, auto)`, a variable that existed solely so the
 * collapse had a number to interpolate away from, since `auto` does not
 * animate. The other pinned `justify-content: center`, so the row of controls
 * stayed under the mark while the box contracted around it; no box contracts,
 * and neither declaration is in the stylesheet any more. What the base rule is
 * still held to is the one thing the third failure mode turns on.
 *
 * Both rules are matched at the START of a line, and that is not cosmetics.
 * `html.designlayer-chrome-hidden .de-toolbar {` also occurs indented inside
 * the reduced-motion block in `css/base.ts`, and an unanchored match found that
 * one instead — a two-declaration fade that satisfies every ban below while
 * saying nothing about the rule that actually hides the bar. The base rule was
 * anchored the other way, on `position: fixed` being its first declaration,
 * which held only for as long as nobody added a declaration above it; it names

 * panel. Sound for the bar, which shares the screen with them. Wrong for the
 * disc, which is only ever ON screen while the editor is stood down — and a
 * stood-down editor has no panels, so those bounds describe a layout that
 * cannot be seen at the same time as the thing they are bounding.
 *
 * It was not a theoretical wrong, either. The disc resolves its saved corner at
 * MOUNT, with the panels open, so a disc left in the bottom-right corner came
 * back clamped to the inspector's inner edge — measured at 282px from the
 * corner it had been put in, against the 32 it was saved at. Closing the
 * inspector did not give it back, because the clamp deliberately only moves a
 * surface as far as it has to and then leaves it alone.
 *
 * So the case is the negative, and it is driven through a RESIZE rather than a
 * panel toggle. Nothing re-places the disc when a panel opens any more — the
 * shell hook that used to is gone, which is half the fix — and a test that only
 * toggled panels would pass on that removal alone while the bounds stayed
 * wrong. Forcing the re-place with the panels at their widest is what actually
 * asks the question.

 * Two objects, two positions, and moving one does not move the other.
 *
 * This replaces "the collapse lands the bar exactly on the disc, wherever it
 * was dragged", which asserted an identity — the bar's collapsed centre plus
 * the published delta IS the disc's centre. That was the right assertion while
 * one surface turned into the other and the two therefore had to share a
 * position. Sharing is the part the user threw out, and the identity it
 * guaranteed is now the bug: a bar that follows the disc is a bar that cannot
 * be parked, which is the whole reason the morph went. So the claim is
 * inverted, and at more than the strength it had: that one pinned one number
 * against another, this pins that the two positions never meet at all.
 *
 * Each drag is followed by a read of the OTHER surface, because a re-coupling
 * announces itself no other way. A shared anchor put back, or one drag's
 * `landed` publishing somewhere the other can hear it, moves the second surface
 * with no error and no visible symptom — until a designer drags the bar out of
 * the way of a cookie banner and finds the disc has left the corner with it.
 *
 * Then the round trip, which is the other half of "it remembers". Nothing is
 * stored and nothing is restored: the position is the box the gesture last
 * resolved, and it outlives the collapse for the plain reason that the element
 * and its listeners do. So a surface that came back on its CSS anchor would
 * mean the gesture had been torn down and rebuilt with the chrome, which is
 * what a re-mount on show looks like from out here.
 *
 * Every number below is an inline style one of these two drags WROTE, never a
 * measured rect, because jsdom lays nothing out — the same reason the drag
 * cases above read positions rather than geometry. `left` on the bar is its
 * centre and on the disc its left edge (see each `paint`), and with a bar
 * measuring zero wide in this harness the two coincide. The targets are chosen
 * inside both surfaces' bounds — the bar's, which are the app area, and the
 * disc's, which are the viewport — so anything that moves between two reads was
 * moved, not clamped.
 *
 * The trip is taken through `setChromeHidden` rather than by writing the flag,
 * because that is the door Cmd+. and the bar's own hide control go through and
 * it does more than set the flag. A test that writes the state directly proves
 * the flag round-trips; this proves the command does.

 * The bar comes back wearing what it went away in.

 * half of what was asked for alongside the two positions: park the bar, set it
 * up the way you want it, stand the editor down to look at the app, bring it
 * back and find it as you left it.
 *
 * The way this breaks is not a button forgetting. Every control in the strip
 * reads its state from the store rather than counting its own clicks, so the
 * failures worth pinning are a hide that tidies up on its way out, and a show
 * that rebuilds the row from the defaults `installToolbar` starts at. Either
 * hands back an editor in Inspect with both panels open — which is exactly what
 * a fresh mount looks like, and therefore reads as deliberate rather than as a
 * loss.
 *
 * Which is why the combination below is one nothing defaults to: notes on, the
 * inspector shut. A reset is invisible to a case that checks the defaults.
 *
 * The mode is driven through `setMode` rather than by writing the two flags,
 * because "annotating and interactive at once" is a state the store exists to
 * make unreachable and a test should not be the one place it is reachable from.
 * The trip itself goes through `setChromeHidden` for the same kind of reason:
 * that is the one function Cmd+. and the bar's hide control both call, so a
 * hide that tidies the mode up on its way out fails here. Writing `chromeHidden`
 * straight into the store steps over the very code most likely to do the
 * tidying, which is how this case would come to pass while the product did not.

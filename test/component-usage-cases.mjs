/**
 * Cases for the component usage counter: the number the editor shows a designer
 * before it lets them edit a component that forty pages render.
 *
 * Everything here runs against REAL projects created under `os.tmpdir()` and
 * thrown away afterwards, with the route driven over a real `http.createServer`
 * on 127.0.0.1 — the harness `audit-cases.mjs` uses, for the same reason. The
 * whole feature is a walk of a directory tree: which files it opens, which it
 * refuses to open, and what it does at the edge of its own budget. A fake
 * filesystem would prove none of that.
 *
 * What is pinned, and why each one is a way this number goes quietly wrong:
 *
 *  - **build output is not walked.** `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/` and
 *    `coverage/` hold compiled COPIES of the same source, so a walk that
 *    entered them would not find new render sites, it would find the same ones
 *    again and hand the designer a doubled number. The fixture plants a
 *    `<Button/>` in every one of them and the count must not move;
 *  - **a lowercase name is refused in words.** `button` is a DOM tag: there
 *    really are `<button>` elements out there and none of them is a render of
 *    anyone's component, so both "0" and "the DOM count" are wrong answers. The
 *    case asserts a refusal sentence AND a zero count, because a refusal that
 *    still carried a number would be read as the number;
 *  - **the file cap reports `truncated`.** A count taken from a partial walk is
 *    a floor, and a UI that cannot tell a floor from a total prints the wrong
 *    one. The case lowers the cap rather than writing three thousand files;
 *  - **the usage LIST being clipped does not set `truncated`.** The two limits
 *    mean different things — one bounds what is listed, the other says the
 *    number itself is incomplete — and collapsing them would make every large
 *    component look like an unfinished walk;
 *  - **a declaration is not a call site, and a render inside the defining file
 *    is.** `export function Button` must never count as a usage of Button, while
 *    a `<Button>` written lower down the same file is a real render. A rule that
 *    skipped the whole defining file would lose it;
 *  - **`.ts` is not scanned as JSX.** `<Button>value` in a `.ts` file is a
 *    TypeScript type assertion. A parser running with the JSX plugin reads it as
 *    an element, so scanning `.ts` would invent a usage that does not exist,
 *    which is worse than missing one;
 *  - **a file that does not parse contributes nothing instead of failing the
 *    answer.** The half-written file is the one the designer is working in, so
 *    it is the likeliest file in the project to be unparseable at the moment
 *    they ask;
 *  - **an Angular usage inside an HTML comment is not a usage.** Commented-out
 *    markup is the commonest false positive a textual search produces, and the
 *    template scanner blanking comments is the reason this one does not;
 *  - **two files declaring the same name are both reported.** The count is by
 *    name and does not resolve imports; when two unrelated `Card`s exist, the
 *    honest answer is to say so rather than to pick one and imply the number
 *    belongs to it.
 *
 * The fixtures are invented — a small React app and a smaller Angular one,
 * written for this file.

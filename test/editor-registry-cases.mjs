/**
 * The register of editors running on this machine, and the chooser rows it
 * feeds.
 *
 * The app chooser used to be able to answer only one question: "what does the
 * start screen say is running". That is a real way to run the editor and it is
 * not the common one. Most sessions are several editors started independently,
 * each pointed at an app that was already up, each with its proxy and socket
 * pinned so they can coexist — and in that shape there is no screen to ask, so
 * the menu said "this session was started without the app chooser" on a machine
 * with six editors on it. `runtime/editor-registry.mjs` is the fix: every
 * editor publishes a small file at boot, so any one of them can list the rest,
 * and switching becomes a NAVIGATION to another editor's proxy rather than a
 * request to kill this process and spawn the next.
 *
 * Two halves, and the cases below are split the same way.
 *
 * ## The registry, which is a directory of claims
 *
 * An entry is a claim and not a fact. An editor killed with SIGKILL never gets
 * to withdraw its own, so the reader has to sweep — and the sweep is the case
 * that matters most here, because a registry that accumulates the dead offers
 * rows that navigate to nothing. Everything else in that half is about
 * degrading rather than throwing: no directory, a half-written file, somebody
 * else's file in the folder, a home directory that cannot be written to at all.
 * The launcher publishes before the editor is of any use to anybody, so a
 * registry that throws is an editor that does not start.
 *
 * ## How this suite avoids taking down the real one
 *
 * `registryDir()` is `~/.local/state/designlayer/editors`, and `listEditors`
 * DELETES from it. That is the point of it, and it makes a naive suite
 * dangerous: the sweep is aimed by a pid, not by a name, so there is no way to
 * ask for the sweep and have it consider only the rows this file wrote. Run
 * against the real directory, one badly-judged case unregisters every editor
 * the person has open.
 *
 * So the whole suite runs under a `HOME` of its own, in a temp directory, and
 * that is checked rather than assumed: `os.homedir()` is documented to prefer
 * `$HOME` but it is a libuv call that could perfectly well read `/etc/passwd`,
 * and "the override silently did nothing" is exactly the failure that would eat
 * the real registry. `sandbox()` asserts the redirection took on every single
 * case, so a case can only ever write and delete inside its own directory. The
 * alternatives were both worse: patching `fs` hides the thing under test, and
 * adding a seam to the source for the directory would be a parameter that
 * exists only because of this file.
 *
 * ## The chooser half needs no machine at all
 *
 * `createAppSwitcher` takes `editors` and `self` precisely so a suite can
 * describe a machine instead of having to be on one, so the second half hands
 * it entries as plain objects and stubs the start screen behind `fetch`. What
 * is under test there is which rows come back and in what order, and a real
 * screen would only add a second thing that can fail while proving none of it.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/editor-registry-cases.mjs

/**
 * The browser half of libraries: the MERGE that makes a library's tokens
 * indistinguishable from the host's, and the one inspector section that reads
 * back out of the catalog the merge produces.
 *
 * Bundled with esbuild and run in JSDOM against a stubbed `fetch`, the same way
 * `token-cases.mjs` and `inspector-tabs-cases.mjs` run the rest of the client.
 * No server: what these cases are about is what the client does with a library
 * payload, and starting a real one would only add a second thing that can fail.
 *
 * MANAGING the list of libraries is not here, and browsing one no longer
 * exists at all. Add, toggle and remove live in the Libraries section on the
 * right panel's Design system tab and are covered end to end by
 * `design-system-tab-cases.mjs`, which drives the same store through the same
 * stubbed fetch; the component grid that used to sit beside them in the left
 * rail was deleted rather than moved. What is left in this file is the half of
 * the feature that has no surface of its own — a catalog, and an element that
 * turns out to be described by it.
 *
 * What is worth pinning, and why each one is a claim that would be lost quietly
 * rather than loudly:
 *
 *  - **the zero-library path costs nothing.** `activeDesignSystem()` returns the
 *    host's own catalog BY IDENTITY when nothing is enabled. Almost every
 *    session is this session, and a merge that rebuilt an equal-but-different
 *    object on every inspector render would be invisible in every assertion
 *    written with `deepEqual` — while breaking every `===` in the rest of the
 *    editor and rebuilding a 115-token catalog on every number scrub;
 *  - **two libraries may ship the same token.** `color:brand-500` is the most
 *    ordinary name a design system has, so two of them colliding is the normal
 *    case, not the edge. The id prefix is the only thing that stops the second
 *    library's brand colour from replacing the first in the token index — and
 *    the failure is silent: the picker shows the right number of rows and one
 *    of them writes the wrong variable;
 *  - **the inspector cannot tell the difference.** `authoredTokenMatches` binds
 *    an element whose inline style names a LIBRARY variable to that library's
 *    token, through the same code path and the same default registry the host's
 *    own tokens go through. That single assertion is the whole feature stated
 *    once: a library was added, and a real element is now described by it. If
 *    only one case in this file survives, it should be that one;
 *  - **the merge shows up as prose, too.** The inspector's instance section is
 *    the other end of the same catalog: select an element the bridge calls
 *    `Button` and, if an enabled library declares a `Button`, the inspector
 *    shows what that library says about it. It belongs to the LIBRARY rather
 *    than to the name, so turning the library off has to take the section with
 *    it — and the failure either way is a block that simply does not render,
 *    which reads from the outside like "this element is not from a library"
 *    rather than like a bug;
 *  - **and that section is ONE section over TWO sources.** The same block draws
 *    the axes a component's own SOURCE declares and the props a LIBRARY
 *    documents, so the cases below cover the seam the split used to hide: which
 *    of the two wins a name they both claim, which documented props earn a
 *    control and which are only stated, and what a control that cannot reach
 *    the file does instead. The axis half in isolation is `variant-cases.mjs`;
 *  - **a stylesheet nobody registered is a surface nobody styled.** The rules
 *    are asserted as CSS TEXT, not as geometry, because JSDOM parses a sheet
 *    and lays nothing out — every width it reports is the stub installed at the
 *    top of this file. Text is also the only honest way to ask the question
 *    that actually shipped broken this week: `assetsCss` existed, was correct,
 *    and was concatenated into nothing, so the assets browser rendered
 *    completely unstyled and no test noticed.
 *
 * The merge cases drive the real store, not a mock of it: the libraries arrive
 * over the stubbed fetch and are folded in by `refreshLibraries`, and every
 * enable is a PATCH whose response the store adopts. A catalog assembled from
 * rows the test injected itself would pass while wired to nothing.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/library-panel-cases.mjs

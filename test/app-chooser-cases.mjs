/**
 * The app chooser: the control at the top of the left panel that names the app
 * being edited, and the menu that changes it.
 *
 * This is the one surface in the editor whose failure mode is losing the
 * session. Every other control is a view of ONE app; this one decides which app
 * that is, and picking a row here asks a supervisor to SIGTERM this process and
 * start another. So the cases below are chosen for the failures that are silent
 * — a chooser that still draws, still lists, still switches, and quietly does
 * the wrong thing:
 *
 *  - **the current row, matched by port.** The two halves of this answer are
 *    built by different machines and spell loopback differently: the prelude
 *    names the app `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and the scanner names it whichever of
 *    `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]` answered first. A string compare marks nothing as
 *    current on exactly the machines where the scan had to work hardest, and
 *    nothing on screen says so — the menu just looks like it has lost track of
 *    which app you are on. The case that pins this lists the current app at
 *    `[::1]` and the config at `127.0.0.1`;
 *  - **a dropped connection on the switch is USUALLY the success path.** The
 *    supervisor kills this editor — the process serving the page and the route
 *    the POST is in flight to — as soon as it accepts. Treating the rejected
 *    fetch as an error would put a failure message on screen after every
 *    successful switch. Treating it as success unconditionally was worse: a
 *    loopback fetch that failed for any other reason put a handover on screen
 *    over an editor that was working, and held the card open against Escape
 *    while it did. So the page asks whether its own proxy is still answering,
 *    and both answers are pinned. A JSON refusal is a third case, also below;
 *  - **the arm/confirm window, and the fact that it is usually not there.** The
 *    removal queue, the Angular queue and the vendor store live in this tab and
 *    nowhere else, and a SIGTERM takes all three with the document. So a row
 *    pressed with work outstanding names what the next click would cost and
 *    goes on the second press, and a row pressed with nothing outstanding goes
 *    on the first. Both halves are pinned, because each is a regression in the
 *    other direction: an unconditional confirm makes a navigation something you
 *    perform twice, and no confirm at all loses an afternoon of edits to a
 *    misaimed click;
 *  - **a note where the rows would be — never an empty card, and never a note
 *    that is false.** Silence reads as "there are no apps", which is worse than
 *    "one moment". The note that used to stand here for a session with no start
 *    screen was worse still: it told a reader who had just opened the app
 *    chooser that this session had no app chooser;
 *  - **one line per row, and what each state spends it on.** A row printed
 *    three facts on two lines — the name, then the full url, then a clause or a
 *    folder — plus a paragraph under the list, for a control whose whole
 *    question is which app am I on and which could I be. Every character of
 *    those urls before the port was identical on every row, because loopback is
 *    the only thing this editor can be pointed at. So the cases below pin what
 *    the slot beside the name holds in each state — a port, three words on the
 *    row that cannot be opened, a verb and a count while armed, one word while
 *    handing over — and pin the two rules that let the row change what it says
 *    without changing its height, which is what an inline `min-height` used to
 *    buy by measuring.
 *
 * ## What jsdom can and cannot answer
 *
 * It can answer everything about STRUCTURE and BEHAVIOUR: which node is the
 * first child of the panel, what a click posts, which row wears `--current`,
 * where focus lands after Escape. Those are what the cases below drive, with
 * real events against a real tree.
 *
 * It cannot answer anything about the CASCADE — there is no layout, no stacking
 * and no computed z-index — and two of this control's claims are cascade
 * claims: the name truncates rather than pushing the chevron out of the panel,
 * and the menu paints above the panel it drops out of. Those are asserted
 * against the TEXT of `appChooserCss`, the way `layers-cases.mjs` asserts its
 * selected band, because the stylesheet is where the two facts actually live.
 *
 * It also cannot navigate: `window.location.assign` is unforgeable in jsdom and
 * raises "Not implemented" rather than going anywhere. The bundle is handed a
 * proxy `window` whose `location` records the target instead, so the two cases
 * that turn on where the page goes can assert on a URL rather than on a log line.
 *
 * ## Why each prologue gets its own module graph
 *
 * `core/config.ts` reads `__DESIGNLAYER_CONFIG__` ONCE at module load — right
 * for a page whose prologue cannot change its mind mid-session, useless to a
 * suite that needs the control built both named and nameless. So each config is
 * its own bundle, keyed by a `marker` export so the two differ in TEXT: the
 * module registry is keyed by the data: URL, and two byte-identical bundles are
 * one cached module wearing the first lane's config. Installs are cheap after
 * that — `installAppChooser` is a factory and its state is per call — so every
 * case that ends its own page gets a fresh control on an existing graph.
 *
 * The server half is imported directly from `server/apps.mjs` against a stubbed
 * `fetch`, because what is under test there is what it does with the start
 * screen's answer, and a real start screen would only add a second thing that
 * can fail while proving nothing about the relay.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/app-chooser-cases.mjs

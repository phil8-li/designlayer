/**
 * Concentric corners: the guard that keeps the chrome's nested radii honest.
 *
 * Two rounded rectangles, one inside the other, share a centre only if the
 * inner radius is the outer one minus the gap between them. `nest()` in
 * `src/core/tokens.ts` is the only implementation of that rule, and it runs
 * while the stylesheet is being built — so an inset that lands off the radius
 * ramp already fails `npm run build`. This file covers the three things that
 * cannot be caught from inside the function:
 *
 *  1. that the arithmetic is right, including the clamp and the throws;
 *  2. that the CSS actually EMITTED matches what each nest declared — a nest
 *     computed correctly and then not used is the obvious way for this to rot;
 *  3. that no container has quietly appeared which could put a rounded child in
 *     one of its corners without anyone deciding whether it does.
 *
 * (3) is the part that makes this hold over time rather than today. It is not a
 * snapshot of the whole stylesheet — that would fail on every unrelated padding
 * change and get deleted within a month. It fails only for a container whose
 * geometry lets a corner be SHARED: two of its paddings agreeing, so a child can
 * sit the same distance from both edges. Anything else is beside a corner rather
 * than in it, and has no curve to be parallel to.
 *
 * There is a second half to this check that no test can run: whether the
 * elements the stylesheet describes are laid out the way each nest assumed.
 * `tools/concentric-audit.mjs` measures that in a real browser, and is a tool
 * rather than a case because the package does not depend on one.

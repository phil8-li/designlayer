/**
 * The writes that reach the screen and nothing else.
 *
 * `apply-source-cases.mjs` pins the happy path: the async resolver finds the
 * file, the operation queues, jscodeshift rewrites the JSX. This suite pins
 * what happens when that path comes up empty — which on a React 19 page is
 * often. The sync walk always answers `filePath: ""`, the owner-stack resolver
 * hands back a bundler chunk roughly half the time, `isProjectSourcePath`
 * rejects it, and the engine itself refuses operations it cannot locate in
 * source.
 *
 * Every one of those used to end in silence. The user picked a colour in the
 * right panel, the element changed, `hasChanges()` stayed false so "Apply to
 * code" could not write it, nothing was recorded anywhere, and the next hot
 * reload ate it. There was no surface in the editor that admitted the change
 * existed.
 *
 * So the claim under test is narrow and total: a write that cannot reach source
 * lands in the ledger instead, exactly once, with a real from and a real to —
 * and a write that CAN reach source still does, leaving the ledger clean. The
 * second half matters as much as the first; an over-eager fix that stranded
 * everything would fill the outbox with changes that were already written.
 *
 * The last section drives the outbox tab, and holds the rendering claims the
 * deleted `prompts-tab-cases.mjs` used to own: an icon swap and a CSS property
 * do not read the same in a row, an empty side is spelled rather than left
 * blank, a row's own remove drops that row alone, no row prints an absolute
 * path, and the bytes Copy writes are the brief for the rows on screen. They
 * live here rather than dying with that suite because they are all claims
 * about how the editor states what it could not write, which is this suite's
 * subject. `annotation-cases.mjs` owns the stores and the brief underneath
 * them; nothing there renders a row.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/stranded-write-cases.mjs

/*
 * A second bundle, for the cases that have to watch this module start up.
 *
 * Everything above shares ONE instance on purpose. These cases need the
 * opposite: a change-prompt module that has never read storage, evaluated
 * against a config that names a particular app, because what is under test is
 * what the ledger does when the page it was living on goes away. `config` is
 * read once at module load — see the note at the bottom of `core/config.ts` —
 * so an app switch can only be spelled here as a fresh evaluation.
 *
 * The suites above are the reason this matters beyond the chooser. Every one of
 * them proves a change reaches the ledger; not one of them could prove it was
 * still there a second later, because the ledger only ever lived in memory and
 * a reload is not something a module-scoped array can survive.

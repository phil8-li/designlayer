/**
 * The vendored glyph set renders as legal SVG.
 *
 * The source data is authored for React, so it spells presentation attributes
 * `strokeWidth` and carries a custom property — `var(--acme-icon-stroke-width, 2)`
 * in the host set this was first found on — as an
 * attribute value. Both are silent failures: `setAttribute` accepts any name,
 * and custom properties do not resolve in an attribute, so the eight
 * stroke-drawn glyphs drew at the UA's 1px default instead of the 2-unit weight
 * the design system draws them at — ChevronRight among them, which the layers
 * tree and every field row use. Nothing else catches this — it type-checks, it builds,
 * and a test that only asks whether an <svg> exists passes.

 * fill a caller asks for BY NAME, and `auto` — what every other call site gets
 * — is the outline.
 *
 * `COUNTERPARTS` is the exception list, and it is short on purpose. Two kinds
 * of mark earn a place on it. One is a drawing whose runs are ALL open, which
 * floods to nothing — the retired `SlidersHorizontal` came out identical in
 * both weights and the inspector toggle reported nothing on its mark. The other

 * distinguishable in the state where they are on. Those carry a second drawing,

 * stroke, it is an `evenodd` annulus that states its own fill — so the root
 * flood passes straight over it and paints nothing. It is a toggle: without a
 * counterpart the mode switch would draw the same hollow arrow whether or not
 * the editor held the pointer, which is the silent failure this list is for.
 *
 * `MessageSquare` was on this list for one round, while it was native too, and

 * The ink tier — how big a glyph actually DRAWS inside its 24 grid.
 *
 * `viewBox` is not the answer to that question and neither is the `size`
 * argument: two glyphs drawn at the same size read a step apart if one of them
 * fills more of the box. Undo and redo did exactly that — an arc of r=10.003
 * plus a 2-unit stroke put their ink at 0.997..23.003, 22x22, against 20x20 for
 * everything else in the same strip. Both panel toggles carry the same 22 from
 * the other direction — Layers because it is vendored as the host authored it,
 * SlidersHorizontal because it is drawn to match that one.
 *
 * Nothing else catches it. It type-checks, it renders, it passes every
 * assertion above, and the only symptom is that two buttons in a row of six
 * look wrong together. So this measures the geometry the way the renderer will:
 * the union of every shape's own bounds, expanded by half the stroke on each
 * side, because a stroke is centred on its path.

/*
 * A glyph asked for at 16 has to come out at 16, and the stylesheet is where
 * that is won or lost.
 *
 * The note-row actions shipped drawn 4x16 — a quarter of their width, a smear
 * rather than an icon — and every other check in this file passed the whole
 * time. They had to: `icon()` emitted a correct 16x16 `<svg>`, the size was on
 * the ramp, the glyph was centred on its grid. The damage happened afterwards,
 * in layout, from Chrome's UA `padding: 1px 6px` eating twelve of the eighteen
 * pixels the button had. Nothing that reads the DOM in jsdom can see it, because
 * jsdom has no layout at all.
 *
 * So these two check the invariants that make the squash impossible, rather
 * than the rendering that would reveal it. Both live in `css/base.ts`, both are
 * one line, and either one going missing brings the whole class of bug back.

/**
 * The one-click handoff: the button, the queue, and the MCP endpoint an agent
 * sits inside.
 *
 * The claim being pinned is a single sentence — *pressing "Send to agent" ends
 * a `wait_for_change` call that was already outstanding* — and it spans three
 * pieces that are otherwise tested apart. So this suite drives them together:
 *
 *  - the queue's drain-then-block contract, because going straight to the block
 *    loses every click that lands between two calls, which is exactly when a
 *    designer clicks (the agent has just stopped talking);
 *  - the state machine, because a change that stays pending after it is applied
 *    is a change an agent hands itself forever;
 *  - the JSON-RPC surface over real HTTP, because a hand-rolled transport that
 *    answers `tools/list` correctly and `initialize` wrongly connects to nothing
 *    and fails silently in a client's logs rather than here;
 *  - the loopback guard, on the port with no proxy in front of it. This endpoint
 *    can reach the handoff queue, and the queue reaches a coding agent.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/mcp-handoff-cases.mjs

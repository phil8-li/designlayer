 * `onAccent` and `onAccent` was already `#ffffff`, so by the stylesheet the
 * pressed Notes and Inspect squares were drawing a white mark — and on screen
 * they were not: the dark theme's fill was the accent as INK (a light blue
 * meant for strokes on near-black), and white on it measured 1.9:1. A glyph at
 * that ratio does not read as white, it reads as a pale smudge the colour of
 * the chip, which is what the designer reported.
 *
 * So asserting the ink token is white proves nothing on its own, and neither
 * does any single hex. What has to hold is the RELATION between the two halves
 * of the pair, in both themes: the fill is chosen so that white survives on it.
 *
 * 3:1 on the chip, which is the floor a MARK is owed — WCAG 1.4.11, the rule
 * for a control's non-text parts, and the ratio Figma's own selected tool sits
 * at. A word needs 4.5:1 and cannot take this fill, which is why the palette
 * carries a second, darker one: `accentSurfaceText`, checked below at the
 * stricter floor. Two roles rather than one compromise, because a fill dark
 * enough for a label is a fill too dark to read as the same accent the strokes
 * and focus rings are drawn in.
 *
 * Arithmetic, not a browser: every role here resolves to plain hex in both
 * themes. A theme that moves one to a `color-mix()` fails loudly in `hex` below
 * rather than quietly skipping the measurement.

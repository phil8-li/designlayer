/**
 * The audit on screen: badges over the page, rows in the Design system tab, and
 * the one rule that keeps the canvas readable.
 *
 * Bundled with esbuild and run in JSDOM against a stubbed `fetch`, the harness
 * `design-system-tab-cases.mjs` uses — and for the same reason. Everything under
 * test here is what the CLIENT does with a payload of findings; a real server
 * would add a second thing that can fail while proving nothing about the layer.
 * The findings are invented for this file, five of them, each written to make
 * one resolution outcome happen.
 *
 * A finding is a file and a line. A marker is a thing on screen. Almost every
 * claim below is about the distance between those two sentences, and each was
 * chosen because losing it is SILENT — the panel still lists rows, the canvas
 * still paints something, and the wrong thing is true:
 *
 *  - **a state selector resolves to the element, not to the state.** A
 *    `.card__title:hover` rule styles a title. A marker that waited for the
 *    hover would be waiting for a gesture the user has no reason to make on the
 *    one element they were just told to look at, and the finding would read as
 *    "not on this page" on a page that is showing it. The base compound is what
 *    gets marked;
 *  - **a selector the browser cannot parse takes itself down and nothing
 *    else.** `querySelectorAll` throws on anything it does not recognise, so one
 *    stylesheet using a syntax this browser has not shipped would otherwise lose
 *    every other finding's badge. The case asserts the survivors, not just the
 *    absence of a throw, because a layer that caught the error and gave up is
 *    also "no exception";
 *  - **a selector matching nothing is not an error, and is not on this page.**
 *    An audit covers a project; a page shows one screen of it. The finding is
 *    listed and counted in the total, gets no badge, and is excluded from the
 *    "on this page" figure — a panel claiming five while the canvas paints three
 *    reads as a broken marker layer rather than as a true statement about four
 *    other routes;
 *  - **the two layers are exclusive IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.** Showing audit badges
 *    hides note pins, and turning the notes back on hides the audit badges. Both
 *    are asserted separately and deliberately, because one direction working
 *    while the other silently does not is the likely bug — and it is the bug
 *    that produces the screen the exclusion exists to prevent: a round pin and a
 *    square plate on the same top-left corner, one covering the other, the loser
 *    invisible rather than obviously hidden;
 *  - **an error badge and a warning badge differ in more than hue.** Colour
 *    alone is a distinction not every reader can make. The two carry different
 *    classes — which is what lets the stylesheet shape them differently — and
 *    the stylesheet paints them from different tokens. The audit badge's own
 *    shape is checked against the note pin's in the same case, since the point
 *    of the square plate is that it is not a round dot;
 *  - **Ignore takes the marker AND moves the row**, because a dismissal that
 *    left the row where it was would read as a dead button, and one that deleted
 *    the row would leave nothing to undo it with. Unignore puts both back;
 *  - **Hide markers clears the canvas and leaves the list.** It is a statement
 *    about the overlay, not about the audit, and a toggle that emptied the panel
 *    would be a second Audit button that reads as an eye;
 *  - **"Fix 3" means three ticked.** Per-row Fix alone does not satisfy "let the
 *    user choose which ones to fix"; the checkbox subset does, and the footer
 *    button has to be about what is ticked rather than about what is fixable
 *    within it. It is disabled when nothing can be written at all.
 *
 * Everything is driven through the real store: findings arrive over the stubbed
 * fetch and are folded in by `runAudit`, the section is the real
 * `dsLintSection`, and the exclusion is driven by the real state on both
 * sides — `setMarkersShown` from the panel's end and annotation mode from the
 * notes' end, which is the seam a user actually moves. A test that set the flags
 * itself would pass against two layers wired to nothing.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/lint-marker-cases.mjs

/**
 * The Design system tab: the libraries you can draw from, and the audit that
 * says where you did not.
 *
 * It replaces `assets-panel-cases.mjs`, which tested a surface that no longer
 * exists. The Assets browser — the component grid, the cards, the thumbnails,
 * the group drill-down, the search box, the details popover and "Insert
 * instance" — is gone by request, and the library manager it opened is now a
 * `section()` on the right panel beside the audit. So the cases here are not a
 * port of that file's cases; they are the claims the new surface has to keep,
 * and one claim about what it must NOT have grown back.
 *
 * Bundled with esbuild and run in JSDOM against a stubbed `fetch`, the same
 * harness `library-panel-cases.mjs` and `lint-marker-cases.mjs` use, and for
 * the same reason: what is under test is what the CLIENT does with a library
 * payload, and a real server would only add a second thing that can fail while
 * proving nothing about the section.
 *
 * What each case guards, and why losing it would be SILENT:
 *
 *  - **a row per library, saying what it contains.** The counts line is the
 *    only thing on the surface that distinguishes a design system the server
 *    parsed from a file it merely pointed at. A row that lost it still looks
 *    like a row, and a designer reads a library with nothing in it as a library
 *    that is simply off;
 *  - **the browsing UI did not survive the move.** This is the case with the
 *    shortest half-life: a grid, a card or an insert button reappearing here is
 *    exactly what a later change "restoring" the assets panel would do, and
 *    nothing else in the suite would notice. It is asserted as the ABSENCE of
 *    the three hooks that surface owned;
 *  - **the URL CTA posts `{url}` and surfaces a refusal in the server's own
 *    words.** Both halves fail invisibly. A field that never posts reads as a
 *    link that failed to parse; a failure reported as "HTTP 400" instead of the
 *    sentence the route wrote is the difference between a user who can fix
 *    their mistake and one who cannot. So the body of the POST is asserted, and
 *    so is the exact sentence the stub refuses with;
 *  - **the field survives a repaint.** The list rebuilds on every store beat,
 *    including the beat a switch fires, and a CTA rebuilt with it eats a
 *    half-typed URL. Asserted by toggling an unrelated library mid-typing and
 *    reading the field back;
 *  - **a walled link offers a way in, and the way in completes the errand.**
 *    Five claims, and every one of them fails quietly. A refusal that carries a
 *    challenge and draws nothing is a dead end wearing a toast; a wall that
 *    names an OAuth client id or a realm and does not print it withholds the
 *    only two strings a designer cannot look up for themselves; a credential
 *    box that is not a password field puts a bearer token into somebody's
 *    screen recording; a refusal that clears the box sends the designer back to
 *    a terminal for a string they already had; and a sign-in that does not
 *    replay the add leaves them to re-paste a URL the editor is still holding.
 *    The suite asserts the ORDER of the two posts for that last one, because
 *    "signed in" and "added" both being true says nothing about whether the
 *    second happened by itself;
 *  - **the way in is a MODAL, and it behaves like one.** A wall stops the add,
 *    and it used to be answered by a well that unfolded in a 260px column with
 *    the whole panel still live behind it. It is a real `<dialog>` opened with
 *    `showModal()` now, which is where the top layer, the focus trap and the
 *    inertness come from — so the suite pins the element itself, that it is
 *    parked on `document.body` rather than inside a section that can be folded
 *    shut over it, that focus arrives on the card and goes back to the control
 *    that opened it, that dismissing takes the token with it, and that Escape
 *    marks the press spent. That last one is the subtlest: Escape is also the
 *    key that stands the editor down, so a dialog that closed without
 *    cancelling the event would dismiss itself and collapse the chrome on one
 *    press;
 *  - **the first screen of that modal has no jargon on it, and the cases are
 *    written as an ABSENCE.** The dialog used to open on "Sign-in redirect ·
 *    https://…", a Bearer/Cookie rail and a box asking for a Cookie header —
 *    all accurate, all addressed to the wrong reader. It now leads with the
 *    host, what the site wants of them in plain words, and the one fact nobody
 *    guesses: the editor fetches links from its own process, so the session
 *    they have with that site in this browser does not carry. Every protocol
 *    term lives behind an "I have an access token" fold. A register is only
 *    pinnable as an absence — a future "let's say which kind of sign-in it is"
 *    would pass every functional case in this file, because the controls it
 *    drives are all still there, one press down. So the visible text is read
 *    with `[hidden]` subtrees stripped and asserted to contain none of them;
 *  - **four plain sentences for five wall kinds, and the merges carry weight.**
 *    OAuth and a login bounce are one experience from outside and collapse
 *    together; HTTP Basic stays apart because a password is something a reader
 *    may already hold; and a 403 stays apart because it is the one refusal
 *    signing in does not fix — the editor got in and was turned away, so a
 *    dialog telling that reader to sign in sends them round a loop;
 *  - **each wall is named by its MECHANISM, and offers the right credential
 *    first.** The server classifies a refusal by HTTP and OAuth alone, and the
 *    panel's labels have to stay that generic or they describe one company's
 *    stack and mislead about every other. Asserted against three of the five
 *    kinds, each with the credential it should preselect;
 *  - **nothing claims a sign-in the server did not grant.** The list of signed-
 *    in origins is drawn only from what `GET`/`POST /libraries/auth` answered.
 *    Asserted from the refusal case: a rejected credential must leave the list
 *    exactly as empty as it was;
 *  - **DS Lint is a section, with its hooks intact.** The panel was re-housed,
 *    not rewritten: the audit button, the summary, the finding rows and the
 *    footer keep their `data-de-lint` hooks, and `lint-marker-cases.mjs` is
 *    what proves they still behave. What THIS file pins is the housing — a real
 *    `.de-section` whose title is "DS lint" — because the old bespoke header is
 *    the thing a re-housing is most likely to leave behind;
 *  - **the tab renders both, in that order.** Libraries is the vocabulary and
 *    the audit is the list of places the page does not use it. A tab that
 *    rendered them the other way round would work perfectly and read backwards.
 *
 * The fixtures are invented: two synthetic libraries, one candidate file for
 * the project scan, and the parsed library the URL add answers with. They
 * exercise the SHAPES the real ones have without being anybody's real design
 * system.
 *

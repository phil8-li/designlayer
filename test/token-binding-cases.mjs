/**
 * The token bindings after the `Design system` section was dissolved.
 *
 * That section drew ~30 labelled pickers — fill colour, text colour, text
 * style, corner radius, shadow, gap, padding, margin — every one of them naming
 * a CSS property some OTHER section already had a control for. It is gone, and
 * its rows have been redistributed into the sections that own those properties
 * (`src/panels/inspector/token-row.ts` carries the whole argument). This suite
 * exists for the two things that move can silently break, and for nothing else:
 *
 *   1. NO ROW WAS LOST. Each row was drawn behind a gate — "only when the
 *      element can carry it" — and every one of those gates now lives in a
 *      different file. A gate dropped or mistyped in the move deletes a control
 *      from the panel and throws nothing. So for each scenario element below,
 *      the axis is asserted to appear SOMEWHERE in the rendered Design tab.
 *
 *   2. NO ROW IS DRAWN TWICE, which is the entire point of the refactor. Across
 *      the whole rendered tab, `data-de-field="design-system.<axis>"` must
 *      appear at most once. This nearly broke in review on a flex container,
 *      where both the Layout section and the auto-layout block inside it wanted
 *      to draw gap and padding; `drawsSpacingControls` in
 *      `section-autolayout.ts` is the arbitration, and a grid container is where
 *      the two files most nearly disagree — `directionOf` reads grid as "none"
 *      while `laysOutChildren` accepts it.
 *
 * Self-contained, and deliberately so. `token-cases.mjs` pins a real host's own
 * numbers and SKIPS the whole process when no host is on disk, which takes its
 * inspector cases with it; a suite about which controls exist must not be one
 * that quietly stops running in a bare clone. The two catalogs below are
 * fixtures written out in full, so what is stocked on each axis is a fact of
 * this file rather than of somebody's checkout.
 *
 * ## Three defects the merge introduced, found by writing this suite
 *
 * All three are fixed. Their cases are kept, inverted, because each one is a
 * hole the MERGE opened rather than a pre-existing bug — so the merge is what
 * has to keep being tested:
 *
 *   - `corner-radius` vanished entirely on a SQUARE box with the Appearance
 *     per-corner toggle open: the uniform binding went with the fold and the
 *     four meant to replace it were gated away. Impossible before the move,
 *     when the uniform row sat behind a fold of its own.
 *   - `stroke-color` lost the "or a `border*` class" half of its gate.
 *     `hasBorder` was exported to express it and nothing called it — a browser
 *     hid the cost, because `class="border"` computes to 1px there.
 *   - `icon-size` required `role="img"`, an attribute the editor never writes
 *     and Lucide does not emit, which made the row unreachable in the only
 *     case its section runs in.
 *
 * Each case now asserts the FIXED behaviour and says, where it is asserted,
 * what the defect was. A regression re-breaks the case rather than passing it.
 *
 * ## Two things this suite cannot assert, and why
 *
 * `shadow` has no negative. JSDOM computes `box-shadow` as "" on an element
 * that has none, where a browser answers "none" — so the gate
 * (`computed.boxShadow !== "none"`) passes on every element here. The row is
 * asserted PRESENT where it should be and never asserted absent; see
 * SHADOW_IS_UNGATED_UNDER_JSDOM below.
 *
 * JSDOM also does not expand shorthands. `border-radius: 8px` leaves all four
 * `border-*-radius` longhands at 0, so every fixture that needs a real corner
 * writes the four longhands out, exactly as `token-cases.mjs` does.
 *
 * Usage: node test/token-binding-cases.mjs

/**
 * Adding a design system by pasting a URL: what is probed, what is parsed, and
 * what a sign-in wall does to both.
 *
 * Every other library kind is a file this process can open, so its test is a
 * string and a parser. This one is a conversation with somebody else's server,
 * and that makes three things worth pinning that no other suite has to think
 * about:
 *
 *  - **the suite runs offline, always.** `fetchImpl` and `runHelper` are
 *    injected, so nothing here touches the network. That is not tidiness: a
 *    suite allowed to reach the real internet fails on a plane, fails behind a
 *    proxy, and silently changes meaning the day somebody redeploys the site it
 *    points at. Every host below is a documentation domain reserved by RFC 2606
 *    and RFC 6761, so none of them can ever resolve to a real server either;
 *  - **a sign-in wall is the normal case, and it arrives disguised as success.**
 *    Most catalogs worth pointing this at belong to some organisation, and a
 *    refused request mostly does not fail the way a refused request is supposed
 *    to: a `fetch` that follows redirects answers HTTP 200 with a body, and the
 *    body is a login page. So the detection works off the BODY as well as off
 *    the redirect, because following the redirect is exactly what hides the 302.
 *    Left undetected, this feature installs a "library" containing the sign-in
 *    form, reports success, and gives the designer no way to see what happened;
 *  - **cross-origin is the line between a handoff and ordinary routing.** A site
 *    that redirects to its own `/login` is routing inside itself and is not a
 *    wall; a site that sends the request to another host has handed it to an
 *    identity provider. Getting that backwards would refuse to install public
 *    sites for the crime of having a login page.
 *
 * The probe ordering is pinned for a related reason. A designer pastes the page
 * they are reading, which is several levels below the story index describing
 * the whole system, so the walk goes deepest-first and ends at the bare origin.
 * Reverse that order and a Storybook mounted at `/atlas` is found only after
 * the origin has been asked — which on a site that serves its app shell for
 * every path means it is never found at all.
 *
 * The store cases at the end go through a REAL `createLibraryStore` against a
 * real temp directory, because the rules they check are rules about
 * persistence: a URL that could not be READ is installed anyway, carrying its
 * sentence, and a URL that could not be SEEN AT ALL is refused outright.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/library-url-cases.mjs

 * The loop stopped at the wall correctly and the code after it then denied

/*
 * THE SHAPE OF EVERY MODERN COMPONENT EXPLORER, and the one this lane used to

 * every path, so every `index.json` probe comes back as HTML that will not
 * parse, and the whole reading collapses to one component guessed from the URL.
 * The counts read zero, the pickers gain nothing, and the designer reports that
 * they added a design system and no styles appeared. Modelled on a real one.
 *
 * The tokens are in its compiled CSS, which this editor has always known how to
 * read — the lane simply never fetched a stylesheet. Three things have to hold
 * for that to produce the right answer, and this case pins all three:
 *
 *  1. the stylesheets are followed at all;
 *  2. the PREVIEW document's are preferred over the shell's, because the shell
 *     is the tool's own chrome and its CSS is the tool's own theme;
 *  3. a preview candidate that answered with the shell is discarded — on a
 *     catch-all SPA `…/avatar/preview.html` returns the shell with a 200, and
 *     being deeper it is reached before the real `/preview.html`.
 *
 * Drop (3) and this case still satisfies (1) and (2) while returning the
 * chrome's palette, which is the wrong answer wearing the right shape.

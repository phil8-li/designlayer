/**
 * The sign-in flow with a REAL browser, end to end, against a site that walls
 * itself the way an SSO proxy does.
 *
 * `library-signin-cases.mjs` covers every decision around the browser by
 * injecting stand-ins for it. This one launches the actual Chrome, lets it
 * follow an actual redirect chain into an actual sign-in page, and proves the
 * three things that only a real browser can prove:
 *
 *   - the redirect chain is followed and the landing on the target origin is
 *     detected, rather than the poll giving up on a page that did arrive;
 *   - the session the site sets is readable through the DevTools protocol,
 *     including the `HttpOnly` cookie a real proxy uses and `document.cookie`
 *     cannot see — which is the entire reason this flow exists rather than
 *     asking a designer to copy one out of dev tools;
 *   - the captured header opens the wall when the EDITOR'S OWN process replays
 *     it, which is the claim the panel makes when it says "signed in".
 *
 * The fake provider signs itself in without a human. That is the one liberty
 * taken here, and it is the right one: what a person types into their identity
 * provider is not this editor's code, and a test that waited for a password
 * could never run.
 * Everything between the wall and the stored credential is exercised for real.
 *
 * Skipped, loudly, when no Chrome-family browser exists — a machine without one
 * cannot run this flow at all, and `available()` is the thing the panel asks.

 * served only once that cookie is present.

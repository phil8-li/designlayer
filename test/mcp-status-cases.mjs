/**
 * "Is an agent connected?" — the question the Changes tab asks, and the one it
 * used to get wrong.
 *
 * The status block read `endpointListening` and rendered it as "your agent is
 * connected". That flag is set by the LAUNCHER when our own MCP port binds, so
 * it is true from the moment the editor starts and says nothing at all about
 * whether anybody is on the other end. Every designer was told their agent was
 * attached before they had configured one, and the line never changed again —
 * which is exactly what "the coding agent field is not working" looks like from
 * the outside.
 *
 * So the three facts are now reported separately, and this suite pins them
 * against a REAL MCP endpoint over real loopback HTTP: our port being up, an
 * agent having completed a handshake, and an agent being parked in
 * `wait_for_change` right now. Each fails independently and each gets its own
 * sentence in the panel.

/**
 * Selection-model cases for DesignLayer.
 *
 * The model is one rule over (hit, scope, modifiers) and every surface has to
 * ask it the same question, so the ways it breaks are quiet ones: nothing
 * throws, the editor just selects the wrong thing forever. Four claims are
 * pinned here, each for a failure that is invisible from the outside.
 *
 * 1. With nothing drilled into, a plain click answers with the object that was
 *    VISUALLY clicked, and a deep click (Cmd on a Mac, Ctrl elsewhere) with the
 *    exact leaf. The old rule took the direct layer child of the scope root.
 *    That is Figma's rule and it is right on a Figma canvas, where a page's
 *    children are frames — but a document's child is the one element wrapping
 *    the entire app, so measured live before the change EVERY plain click,
 *    anywhere on the page, selected `app-root`. The modifier was the only way
 *    to reach anything, which is exactly backwards. `visualLayer` in
 *    `core/resolve` replaces it, and the "visual layer" cases below are the
 *    only place its geometry is pinned: coincidence, the sole-child wrapper
 *    climb, the area cap, the component-instance stop, the zero-area floor.
 * 2. Once the user HAS drilled in, the direct-child-of-scope rule governs
 *    again, unchanged. Inside a frame the Figma rule is the correct one, and it
 *    is what keeps Enter, Tab, the layers tree and a click agreeing about which
 *    node a gesture can reach. When they disagree the hover outline promises a
 *    selection the click does not make, and no assertion below the rule itself
 *    would notice.
 * 3. The gestures AROUND the rule — double-click drilling, Enter/Shift+Enter,
 *    Tab, shift-toggle, marquee, Escape, the overlap menu — read a resolved
 *    value but must not depend on which one. They are asserted from their new
 *    starting points so that a later change to the resolver cannot quietly take
 *    one of them with it.
 * 4. Ctrl is not deep select on a Mac, and `aria-hidden` is not hidden. Both
 *    are one-line mistakes that leave every other case green.
 *
 * Level 1 exercises the resolver and the keymap as units. Level 2 mounts the
 * real canvas lane over a jsdom fixture and drives it with genuine events, so
 * the assertions cover the wiring — which modifier reaches which branch, what
 * the scope becomes — and not just the pure functions underneath.
 *
 * jsdom is the sanctioned DOM-test path here: the selection model is a rule
 * over hit/scope/modifiers, and none of that needs a compositor. It performs no
 * layout, though, and the new rule is a rule about geometry, so the geometry is
 * declared per element — see `BOXES`.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/selection-cases.mjs

 * - `cta` is a padded button around its label, the case coincidence cannot
 *   carry.
 * - `collapsed` > `pin` is an empty wrapper: zero area, and zero-coincident
 *   with everything else that is zero.
 * - `stage` > `mark` is a sole-child wrapper far bigger than its child, the

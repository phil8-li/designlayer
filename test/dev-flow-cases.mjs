/**
 * The one-command flow: start the app, then attach to it.
 *
 * What is worth pinning here is not that `npm run dev` boots Next — that is the
 * host's business — but the three decisions this package makes around it:
 *
 *  - a server it did NOT start is not one it may stop. `started: false` is the
 *    whole guard, and a `stop` that killed an attached process would take down
 *    a terminal the user is still using;
 *  - a dev script that dies has to be reported as a dev script that died,
 *    rather than as the port timeout it would otherwise look like 60s later;
 *  - `--dev-script` implies `--dev`, and the CLI still refuses every flag it
 *    does not declare — the vendor's commander aborts on anything that leaks
 *    through, so an accepted-but-ignored flag is a broken launch;
 *  - an app that answers 500 is an app that is running. The vendor's health
 *    check disagrees, so these run the vendor's own `healthCheck` against real
 *    listeners to pin both halves: a broken app is attachable, a dead port is
 *    still dead.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/dev-flow-cases.mjs

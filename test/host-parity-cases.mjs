/**
 * The right panel, rendered once per host, with every section accounted for.
 *
 * The Angular lane was built by making one write path work and then checking
 * the rest by hand. That is not a thing anyone can repeat, and by-hand is how
 * three of these were missed the first time: a Responsive section offering
 * Tailwind breakpoints to a project with no Tailwind, a Code tab spelling an
 * Angular element as JSX, and an AI prompt telling an agent to edit the
 * `className` in a template whose attribute is `class`.
 *
 * So this mounts the real inspector against a real DOM under each host config
 * and asserts on what a designer would actually see. Two rules hold it
 * together:
 *
 *  - Every section is named. A section that renders on one host and not the
 *    other has to say why here, which is what stops "it disappeared" from being
 *    discovered in a browser six weeks later.
 *  - What differs is only ever what MUST differ. The panel is one product; the
 *    host decides how an edit is spelled, not which controls exist.
 *
 * Usage: node designlayer/test/host-parity-cases.mjs

/**
 * The sign-in that opens the SITE'S OWN login rather than asking for a token.

 * usable session is reported as a sentence rather than stored as a sign-in.
 *
 * The browser itself is not launched. A test that opened a real window would

   * The raise is best-effort, and this is what makes that sentence true.
   *
   * Bringing the window to the front sends an Apple event to another
   * application, which on a machine that has not granted this process
   * automation rights opens a consent dialog — BEHIND other windows, which is
   * the very failure the raise exists to fix, so nobody sees it to answer it.
   * The helper resolved only on the child's exit, so the sign-in loop never
   * started: no window the person could use, no ceiling, no end.
   *
   * The helper is injected because this branch runs only on the visible pass
   * and only where a raise mechanism exists; the stand-in is a process that
   * starts, records its pid and then does nothing at all, which is what the
   * blocked `osascript` looks like from here. What is asserted is that the run
   * came back and that nothing it started is still alive.

   * Landing required a 2xx document on the target origin with the address bar
   * to match, and escalation to a visible window required parking CROSS-origin.
   * A site that renders its own `/login` at 200 satisfies the first and can
   * never satisfy the second — so the silent pass "landed" on the login screen,
   * scraped the CSRF cookie it had set, and reported success. No window opened.
   * Same-origin login pages are the norm rather than the exception: a
   * self-hosted Storybook behind a form, a dashboard with a JavaScript auth
   * gate, anything that routes to a login instead of redirecting to one.
   *
   * Both modes are asserted together on purpose. Refusing to land is trivial to
   * get right by never landing at all, and that would break every sign-in this
   * module exists for; the control run proves the one difference between the
   * two pages — a password input — is what decided it.

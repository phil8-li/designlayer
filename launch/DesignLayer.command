# It lands you on the PROJECT CHOOSER, which lists the prototypes running on
# that machine and lets you pick one — and switch to another later without
# coming back here. It does the parts you would otherwise do by hand: start the
# chooser, connect the ports, open the browser.
#
# An earlier version of this script named one prototype and passed `--dev`,
# which skips the chooser and attaches straight to that app. That is the right
# shape for a script you run in one repo all day and the wrong one for a
# launcher, which is exactly the moment you have not yet said which prototype
# you mean.

#
# This script used to hardcode one person's dev host, the jump-host helper their
# employer ships, and the path their checkout happens to live at. That makes it
# a script exactly one machine can run, and it puts an internal hostname in a
# public repository — so the three facts that differ per person are read from
# the environment instead, and the only one with no sensible default is refused
# rather than guessed.
#
#   DESIGNLAYER_REMOTE_HOST   required. Anything `ssh` accepts: `devbox`,
#                               `user@10.0.0.4`, or a Host alias from
#                               ~/.ssh/config — which is the better place for
#                               the user, port, key and any ProxyCommand.
#   DESIGNLAYER_REMOTE_PATH   where designlayer is checked out over there.
#                               Default: ~/src/designlayer
#   DESIGNLAYER_SSH_PROXY     a ProxyCommand, for a network that needs one to
#                               reach the host at all. Usually unset, because
#                               ~/.ssh/config is where this belongs.
#
# Set them for a double-clicked script — which inherits no shell profile — by
# putting them in `launch/.env` next to this file. That path is gitignored, so
# your host stays yours.

  No remote host is configured.

  This launcher opens the editor against a dev machine you reach over SSH.
  Tell it which one, once:

      echo 'DESIGNLAYER_REMOTE_HOST=my-devbox' > launch/.env

  Anything ssh accepts works — a Host alias from ~/.ssh/config is the best of
  them, because the user, port, key and any ProxyCommand belong there rather
  than in this script.

  Running the editor on THIS machine needs none of it: `npm start` in the
  project root opens the same chooser with no tunnel in the way.

Could not reach $REMOTE_HOST.

Almost always one of three things:
  • Your SSH credentials expired, or your key wants a touch. Run
    \`ssh $REMOTE_HOST\` in a terminal and see what it asks for.
  • You are off the network that host is on, or its jump host is down.
  • The name is wrong. It comes from DESIGNLAYER_REMOTE_HOST, which
    launch/.env is the usual place to set.

Then double-click this again.

/**
 * The start screen's HTTP server, and the handoff back to cli.mjs.
 *
 * Until now the only way in was `designlayer --dev 3000`, so the port, the
 * project root and the dev script all had to be known before anything was on
 * screen. This server is the other order: bind on loopback first, let the page
 * ask what is running and what is on disk, and end with one validated choice.
 * `chosen` IS that handoff — the CLI awaits it, then loads that project's
 * config and boots the proxy.
 *
 * One choice used to be all there was: `/api/start` latched shut after the
 * first press and the page redirected to the editor forever after, so the only
 * way to design a different app was to kill the process. The handoff is a
 * sequence now — `nextChoice()` for each round, `reportReady` and
 * `reportStopped` for what became of it — and this server outlives every editor
 * it hands off to.
 *
 * The page is untrusted input like any other client, so the refusals on
 * `/api/start` are the safety story of the feature, not a formality: this
 * process rewrites source files and proxies whatever origin it is handed. Each
 * refusal is a sentence, because whoever reads one is looking at a screen.

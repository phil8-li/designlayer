 * THE PRESS, WHICH THE BUTTON THAT STARTS THE PRODUCT DID NOT ANSWER.
 *
 * Pressing this posts to the loopback server, waits for a dev server to come up
 * and then navigates — seconds, on a cold start — and for the first of those
 * seconds nothing on screen changed at all. The \`busy\` state below arrives
 * later and through a different channel, so the gap between "I clicked" and
 * "something is happening" was carried by nothing.
 *
 * The kit's press — 0.98 over the \`hover\` tween — which is the depth and the
 * clock the editor's own controls use — this page borrows the chrome's \`--ease\` and durations already, so the
 * press feels like the same product it is about to open. \`:not(:disabled)\`
 * because a button that will not act must not answer as though it had.
 *
 * \`.app\` is deliberately NOT given one. A row in a list is a selection, and it
 * answers with its own tick and the field it fills in; a row that also shrank
 * would be claiming to be a button that does something.

 * is how you find out which field that is. What is left is \`busy\`, the in-flight
 * moment between the press and the editor coming up, where a second press would
 * post a second start. That one is a real "you cannot do this yet", and it lasts
 * a second rather than the whole visit.

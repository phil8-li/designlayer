 * style, inline module script, no fetches for anything but its own loopback
 * JSON routes.
 *
 * Everything the script renders from the server — a page title, a folder name,
 * an error sentence — arrives as untrusted string data and is written with
 * `textContent`. That is the whole injection surface of this feature, and it is

    THE WHOLE SCREEN IS ONE QUESTION — which app do you want to edit — AND IT
    HAS EXACTLY TWO ANSWERS: pick one that is running, or describe one that is
    not. Everything below is that shape, and it used to be six sentences.

    The two answers are two groups with a rule between them carrying the word
    "or". A rule is the LAST tool the layout guidance reaches for, and it is the
    right one here for the reason that guidance gives: space can say "these are
    different things", but only a word can say "these are alternatives, do one".
    Read without it, the list over the fields is a sequence — pick an app, THEN
    fill these in — which is the wrong model and the one the deleted prose spent
    twenty words correcting.

    Both the rule and the list's heading come and go with the list itself (see
    \`.has-apps\`). With no dev server up there is no alternative to be the
    second of, so the card is a wordmark, one grey line saying nothing is
    running, two labelled boxes, and the button.

      The other answer: the two things the editor needs about any app, as two
      rows of one grid rather than two stacked stanzas of label, box and
      paragraph. One label column, one field column, one shared edge each — the
      pair reads as a single short form at a glance, which is what it is.

      The help under each field is gone with the stanzas. "The address you would
      open in the browser" restated the label beside a placeholder already

      NO \`role="status"\` on this element, though it carried one briefly. An

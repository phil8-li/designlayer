/**
 * Getting the host app running before the editor attaches to it.
 *
 * The vendored CLI health-checks the app port and refuses to boot when nothing
 * answers, so until now the app had to be started by hand in another terminal
 * and the editor command was useless until that one was warm. This module is
 * what collapses the two into one: probe the port, attach silently if something
 * already answers, otherwise run the host's OWN dev script and wait for it.
 *
 * It guesses nothing on the host's behalf. The script is the host's own, so
 * whatever that script already does keeps happening.
 *
 * `portFlag` and `hostFlag` are the exception, and they are passed in rather
 * than decided here. Neither `vite` nor `ng serve` reads `PORT`, and both
 * default to binding `localhost` — which on an IPv6-first machine is `[::1]`
 * and not `127.0.0.1`, so the app comes up perfectly and the caller, probing
 * `127.0.0.1`, never sees it. Which flags a host takes is a property of its
 * framework, which the resolved config already knows; this module appends them.

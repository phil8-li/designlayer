/**
 * Every editor running on this machine, so that any one of them can list the
 * others.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The app chooser was built on the start screen: a supervisor keeps one screen
 * alive, the screen scans for apps, and switching means asking it to kill this
 * editor and spawn the next. That is a real way to run the editor and it still
 * works — but it is not the way most sessions actually look.
 *
 * The common shape is several editors, each started on its own against an app
 * that was already running, each with its proxy and socket pinned so they can
 * coexist. There is no supervisor in that picture and no screen to ask, so the
 * chooser had nothing to offer and said so: "this session was started without
 * the app chooser". Which was true, and useless — the machine had five editors
 * on it at the time.
 *
 * ## Why a registry rather than a port scan
 *
 * Every editor already writes an endpoint file naming its pid, its proxy port
 * and the project it was pointed at. The problem is only that it writes it
 * INSIDE that project (`<project>/.local/designlayer/endpoint.json`), so an
 * editor can read its own and nobody else's.
 *
 * Scanning ports instead was the obvious alternative and it is wrong here.
 * Prototypes do not sit on a guessable range: the five running while this was
 * written were on 4200, 5180, 5190, 5197 and 8080, and a scan of the usual
 * suspects would have found two of them. A registry reports what is actually
 * there, costs one small file per editor, and carries the project root — which
 * a scan can only guess at by reading paths out of a served page.
 *
 * ## Liveness
 *
 * An entry is a claim, not a fact: a process that is killed hard never gets to
 * withdraw its own. So every read checks the pid is still alive and quietly
 * sweeps the ones that are not, which also keeps the directory from growing a
 * file per editor ever run. `process.kill(pid, 0)` is the check — it sends no
 * signal and only reports whether the process exists.
